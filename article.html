<h1>Ecological Artificial Intelligence </h1>
<h2 id='subtitle'> Grounding Artificial Intelligence in the Origins of Human Behavior </h2>


<p> 'Can machines think?' When Turing posed this question in his seminal paper
    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1951-02887-001"> Computing machinery and intelligence </a>
    <dt-cite key="turing_computing_1950"> </dt-cite> in the '50s,  he inadvertently laid the ground for what was to
    become the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ground was set firmly: generations of researchers have been
    engineering cognitive architectures and introducing objective functions that we evaluate on carefully selected
    benchmarks, abiding to the Turing-test tradition. </p>

<p> We call this the <em> cognition-centric </em> approach and want to contrast it to the <em> ecological </em>
        approach. Under this alternative attitude towards creating AI, intelligence is viewed as an emergent product
        of adaptive systems interacting with their environments. While cognition-centric approaches attempt to reverse-engineer
    intelligent behavior by searching in the space of cognitive functions, ecological approaches search in the space of
    environmental properties to reverse-engineer the conditions that drive intelligent behavior.
</p>

    <p> Ecological perspectives abide in the study of biological organisms. From the emergence of vision systems
        <dt-cite key="gibson__2014"> </dt-cite>
         to that of religious beliefs <dt-cite key="botero_ecology_2014"> </dt-cite>, the environments encountered in a
        species' evolutionary trajectory have been used to explain why
        certain functions persist over others.
    </p>

    <h4> In this blog post, we will discuss why and how we should pursue an ecological approach to AI. In particular, we will: </h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;padding:10px">  From drug discovery to music composition, our human cultural repertoire relies on innovations produced
    by collectives that jointly explore, communicate and recombine solutions. Can artificial agents also innovate in
    collectives? In the learning paradigm of distributed RL, groups of agents solve tasks in parallel and share their
    experiences with observed benefits to performance. But, while biological organisms exhibit a variety of social
    network structures,, distributed RL agents always share with everyone. Here, we study the effect of social network

<p> At a first glance these two studies have nothing in common, except perhaps for their ecological attitude towards
    skill acquisition. At the end of this post we will see, however, that there is room for exchanging ideas between
    the two: recent ecological theories posit that elements in our environment such as the Sahara desert act as
    ecological barriers that prohibit immigration but can disappear during periods of extreme climatic variability
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQP-7BPvvq0"> did you know the Sahara was green a few tens of thousands
        of years ago?  </a> <dt-cite key="larrasoana_dynamics_2013"> </dt-cite>. This means that climatic variability
    may have affected social network structure, with interesting implications for the populations that needed to survive
    at the time  ...

    <h2 id="open-ended-skills-in"> Open-ended skills in biological and artificial agents </h2>

    <p> What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "open-endedness"? For many scientists,
        engineers and artists, it is "life" or "evolution", words that conjure images of biological agents with a wide
        diversity of forms and functions, entangled in a complex web of interactions. What makes biological
        open-endedness particularly mind-boggling is not just the diversity and complexity of solutions, but the
        apparent simplicity of the algorithm that continuously gives rise to them: evolution. </p>

    <p> AI researchers were also inspired from the open-endedness of biological evolution and attempted to imitate it by
        building artificial agents with large behavioral repertoires. Largely owing to achievements in deep learning,
        optimization using  reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms managed to produce agents with impressive
        behavioral repertoires:  populations of RL agents co-adapting with their environments managed to develop
        morphologies that can walk on challenging terrains <dt-cite key="wang_paired_2019"> </dt-cite>, a single RL agent
        trained using techniques developed for language models managed to play Atari games,
        chat and control a robotic arm <dt-cite key="reed_generalist_2022"> </dt-cite>, a team of RL agents playing
        Hide-and-Seek learned how to manipulate items in their environment to continuously pose new challenges to
        another team <dt-cite key="baker_emergent_2020"> </dt-cite>  and evolutionary algorithms that optimize for both
        diversity and quality managed to solve deceptive

<p> However, <b> progress in this direction is being hindered by </b>:  </p>

    <nav id="contentBlog" class="l-body" >

    <li style="..."> <b> the computational complexity of training large neural networks </b> One of the properties
        that we emphasize  when characterizing a skill as impressive, is the task complexity, largely associated to
        the size of the solution space an algorithm needs to search in to find the optimal behavior. In stark
        contrast to biological organisms that operate under severe constraints, such as energy consumption,
        artificial agents are classically trained from scratch with immense computational resources.
        (See Figure 1 for a ..). <a href="https://otoro.net/ml/"> The community has voiced its concerns about this
        attitude </a>  but who would expect AI researchers to self-limit their
        consumption of resources, even if this would be useful in the long-term? </li>
    <li style="..."> <b> brittleness of learned policies </b>  In nature, an organism's ability to solve a task
        usually implies that it can solve other similar tasks, an ability that we refer to as generalization. While
        a lot of progress is being made in generalization in AI, RL agents sometimes fail to generalize in cases
        that to humans seem trivial: see for example in Figure 2 the agent that learned how to beat humans in
        Pong but failed when the paddle was moved slightly up and to the right. </li>
    <li style="..."> <b> the deceptiveness of tasks </b> Evolutionary and RL algorithms classically take the
        optimization objective for granted, as it is provided  by the human designer. However, most trully
        challenging tasks are deceptive: if you directly optimize for the objective you want to evaluate it for, you
        will never achieve it, because greediness will keep you away from paths that you need to first explore. An exa </li>

</nav>


<p> We believe that these challenges are due to remnants of the cognition-centric approach and that an ecological
    approach can help us overcome them</p>

<h2 id="framework"> A conceptual framework for linking human and artificial ecologies </h2>

<p> We recently proposed <dt-cite key="nisioti_grounding_2021"> </dt-cite> that a possible pathway
    to overcome  these challenges  is by grounding our pursuit of open-ended skill acquisition in artificial
    systems in our knowledge of a natural species with an impressively open-ended behavioral repertoire: our own.
</p>


<p> Our methodology was three-step:

<ol type="1">


    <li style="..."> skim the Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) literature to identify the key factors that this
        community proposes as conducive for the evolution of the uniquely diverse human cultural repertoire
</li>
    <li style="..."> identify common research questions and hypotheses in AI, in particular the sub-fields of
        meta and multi-agent reinforcement learning
</li>
    <li style="..."> abstract away the particularities of the two fields to arrive at a  conceptual framework that
        unifies their terminologies and research agendas.
</li>

</ol>


<p> Here is our conceptual framework, to which we refer to as <em> ORIGINS </em>, that our work led to: </p>



<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/framework.png" height="465" width="665" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> Conceptual framework  <a href=""> []</a></i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> The schematic consists of two elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li> boxes represent categories of ecological mechanisms. </li>
    <li> arrows represent relationships between ecological components:
    <ul> <li> A feedforward link between box 'X' and 'Y' indicates that environmental dynamics inside 'X' is driving a
        skills inside 'Y'. In other words, it is acting as a selection pressure. For example, the fact that exposition
        to predators can promote cooperation is captured by the link
        [Environmental complexity] -> [Multi-agent dynamics]</li>
        <li> A feedback link between box 'X' and 'Y' has a different meaning: a skill in 'X' is modifying its
            environment by changing the dynamics in 'Y'. For example, the fact that tool use can alter resource
            availability is captured by the link [Cultural repertoire] -> [Environmental complexity]. </li>
    </ul>

    </li>
</ul>

<p> To discover works that study these links, including our own, you can hover over the arrows in the image.

</p>

<p> The story that the conceptual framework tells, put succinctly, is:
</p>

<p> <em> Environmental complexity  has a key role in  skill acquisition: it bootstraps the emergence
    of individual skills by modulating the need  for cognitive mechanisms and multi-agent skills through cooperation
    and competition pressures. The skills themselves then act as drivers of further skill acquisition in two ways:
    a) they interact with each other to give rise to the uniquely complex human cultural repertoire b)  they modulate
    environmental complexity through the process of niche construction, which creates a positive feedback loop that
    makes the process open-ended. </em> </p>

<p> <em> ORIGINS </em>  can be a useful tool for both communities:  AI researchers can borrow existing hypotheses from
    HBE about which environmental conditions affect which skills to appropriately shape their environments, an approach
    that we refer to as ecologically-inspired AI. At the same time, HBE researchers can use AI as a computational tool
    for studying their hypotheses.</p>
<p> In the rest of the post we give a more illustrative example of  ecologically-inspired AI through two of our works:
    we will zoom in in two different parts of the framework, discuss the ecological hypotheses they were inspired from,
    and then present the artificial ecologies we implemented to study them. </p>

<h2 id="Study-A"> Study A: Evolution of plasticity and evolvability in variable environments </h2>

<h3> Background in HBE </h3>
<p> What makes us human? For HBE researchers, this is not a philosophical inquiry, but a rather pressing scientific
    question: why did the first hominin species appear about 5 million years ago and which skills did they evolve
    that allowed them to expand into a  population that today holds a powerful position in the Earth's  ecosystem?</p>

<p> When we trace back the history of our planet, we find climatic records of very ''busy" periods : many rapid and
    large-amplitude climatic cycles have taken place in the last few milliion years, leading to high levels of climate
    change that must have significantly shaped populations at a global and local scale. Our own hominin space appeared
    and dispersed during such periods, competing and reproducing with other species.

</p>

<div style="clear: both;float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: calc((100vw - 1500px) / 2 + 168px);
width: calc((1500px - 648px) / 2 - 24px);">
  <img src="public/climate_Maslin.png" alt="scheme" style="width:94%">
    <p> Paleoclimatology records indicate that periods of high climatic variability were linked to the formation of
        lakes and the appearance of new hominin species.
        <dt-cite key="maslin_east_2014"> </dt-cite> Image source </a>   </p>
</div>

<p> How exactly did climatic conditions affect the evolution of the human species? The Pulsed Climate Variability
    (PCV) framework <dt-cite key="maslin_synthesis_2015"> </dt-cite>  has formalized this question into a set of
    hypotheses of how types of environmental variability affect evolutionary phenometa such as speciation, extinction,
    dispersal and diversity. </p>

<p> Under the PCV framework species are divided into two broad types: specialists are species that can survive in a
    limited range of environmental conditions, while generalists survive in a large range of conditions. As humans are
    a remarkably generalist species, we are very interested in which ecological conditions give rise to this type.
    With incomplete data about the environmental conditions and species of this period and, in the absence of
    theoretical models, answering this question in HBE in the near future seems unlikely. </p>

<h3> Background in AI </h3>

<p> A similar story has been unfolding in AI: in its quest for artificial agents that can generalize and quickly
    adapt to new tasks, the meta RL paradigm trains agents in a wide distribution of environments
    <dt-cite key="vanschoren_meta-learning_2018"> </dt-cite>.
 </p>


<p> Here, the agent adapts at two levels:
    <ul>
    <li> in an outer loop, we choose the environment that the agent will train on by
    randomly sampling out of a distribution of environments. This distribution is designed to balance between two
    objectives: on one hand we want this distribution to be as wide as possible, as this width determines the
    achievable generality of the agent. On the other hand, we want to keep the computational complexity low. This
    trade-off is usually solved by training meta-RL agents in a single domain (for example mazes with different
        layouts), but we have impressive examples of meta-Rl agents that can Atari games, chat and control a robotic
        arm <dt-cite key="reed2022a"> </dt-cite> </li>
    <li> in an inner loop, the agent learns to solve a single environment. But because this
    environment changes at every new outer loop, the agent is learning how to learn rather than learning the specific
    task. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> To draw a parallel with biological agents, we can see the outer-loop implementing the adaptive mechanism of
    evolution and the inner loop the adaptive mechanism of development.
</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/meta_RL.png" height="200" width="465" alt="metaRL" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> In meta-RL an agent is trained on a distribution of environments. </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> The main limitation here is computational complexity: the distribution of environments needs to be sampled
    densely enough to ensure generalization while the set of environments considered is limited within a single domain
    (for example mazes with different layouts). Also meta-learning set-ups usually consider a stationary distribution
    for sampling environments, thus ignoring the benefits of environments with certain dynamics, such as the ones
    proposed by the PCV framework </p>

<h3> A simple eco-evo-devo model </h3>

<p> Recently  we proposed a simple model for studying how populations of adaptive agents evolve  in variable
    environments <dt-cite key="nisioti_plasticity_2022"> </dt-cite>. Our objective was to provide a computational
    study of the hypotheses described under the PCV framework, drawing conclusions that in their turn can prove useful
    for evolutionary optimization and meta learning.</p>

<p> An important challenge in this project was to design an experimental setup that is powerful enough to capture the
    ecological dynamics and the evolution of diverse phenotypes but still computationally cheap so that we can simulate
    a wide range of conditions and large populations. </p>



<h4> Modeling an adaptive population. </h4>

<p> In AI, quantifying plasticity requires to simulate the interaction between an agent and the environment over many
timesteps (as e.g. in RL).  To avoid this complexity  of introducing an intra-lifetime loop for evaluation tasks, we
    have adopted tolerance curves, a tool originally  developed in ecology to model biological organisms <dt-cite
            key="grove_evolution_2014"> </dt-cite>.
</p>



<p> Tolerance curves have the form of a Gaussian whose mean shows the preferred environmental state of an individual and
    variance its plasticity, i.e., its ability to survive under different environmental conditions: </p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/tolerance_curves.png" width="65%" alt="toleranceCurve" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> An agent with low plasticity (on the left) has small &\sigma; and a high peak at their preferred niche, while a
    plastic individual (on the right) has large &\sigma; and a lower peak at their preferred niche. Fitness in a
    certain environmental state is computed as the probability density function of the distribution at that point
the plastic individual has lower fitness (cost of plasticity). If $e_n >>\mu_k$ (the actual environmental state differs
    significantly from the preferred one) the plastic individual has higher fitness (benefit of plasticity)

</i></sub>
</div>
    </div>

<p> Tolerance curves elegantly capture the cost and benefit of plasticity: if a plastic and non-plastic agent compete
    in an environment that is identical to their preferred niche, the plastic one will lose as its peak is lower. But
    if, for some reason, the environment changes in the next generation so that it differs from the preferred niche
    of the two individuals, the plastic one will be at an advantage.
</p>

<p> In addition to this plasticity, an agent can adapt using its evolvability (r;), which refers to the amount of
    mutations that take place between generations.
</p>

 <p>
To decide which agents in a population survive in the following generation we implemented two selection mechanisms:
 </p>

<ul>
    <li> fitness-based selection. This is the classical survival-of-the-fittest critertion where agents are selected
        proportionally to their fitness </li>

    <li> niche-limited competition. Under this mechanism, agents surviving in a niche reproduce within it, with the
        number of reproductions being limited by capacity. Thus, an agent can increase its chances of reproduction by
        surviving in multiple niches. </li>

</ul>

<p> At each generation, the three elements of an agent's genome evolve as: </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">

<var> &mu; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>&mu; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
<var> &sigma; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>&sigma; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
<var> r; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>r; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
</div>




<h4> Modeling an ecologically-complex environment </h4>

<p> We have hinted that we want to simulate a variable environment, but how exactly can we go about this, while
    keeping the computational complexity of the simulations low? In this work, we have defined a model that comprises a
    number of niches &N and a climate function e_g that characterizes the environmental state of each niche.  </p>


<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/niches.png" width="65%" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> The environment consists of multiple niches, each characterized by its latitude $n$ and a climate function that has
    the same form for each niche except by a vertical offset proportional to the niche index.</i></sub>
</div>
</div>



<h4> Observing populations evolve under climate change </h4>

<p> To disentangle the effect of the two selection mechanisms we experimented with three variants of the evolutionary
    algorithm:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> F-selection employs only fitness-based selection </li>
    <li> N-selection employs only niche-limited competition</li>
    <li> NF-selection employs both </li>
</ul>

<p> We have also simulated words with various number of niches and three types of climate functions:</p>
<ul>

    <li> <b> stable climate </b> Here we can control the quality of the climate: words with higher environmental
        states are higher quality, as they can support larger populations. In this case, we saw that low-quality
        environments with multiple niches favor plasticity provided niche-limited competition is active: as an
        individual can reproduce in any of the niches it can survive in, higher plasticity means higher chances of
        reproduction, which counteracts the cost of plasticity. As the quality of environments increases the benefit of
        plasticity disappears: non-plastic individuals dominate the available niches even though some individuals choose
        to disperse.
    </li>
    <li> <b> sinusoid variation </b> Here, we can control the amount and frequency of variation. We observed
        F-selection and N-selection lead to mal-adapted populations that can tolerate less change.
        .. </li>
    <li> <b> Noisy climate </b> Here, we control for the amount of uncertainty. We observed that introducing
        niche-limited competition is necessary for the population to survive and that N-selection adapts purely
        through plasticity while NF-selection adapts through both plasticity and evolvability.
    </li>
</ul>


<p> We observed that the three algorithms lead to very different behavior. For example, for sinusoidal variation under
    F-selection the plasticity and the evolvabiltiy of the population is low and variability is dealt with by
    continous migration as the following visualization shows on the left. In contrast when we employ NF-selection
    in the same environmental setup both plasticity and evolvability remain high and the population expands to all
    niches (on the right). </p>

<h3> Discussion </h3>
<p> In these experiments, agents can freely moves in niches, as long as they can survive in them. If they have high
    plasticity, the population therefore necessarily becomes well-mixed. This contrasts with real ecological
    dynamics, where ecological barriers can appear and disappear. For example, under the Green Sahara ... and the
    Iberian ..., . Such conditions are hypothesizes to have an important effect on both biological and cultural
    evolution <dv-cite key="derrico_evolution_2011">  </dv-cite>  <dv-cite key="derrico_identifying_2013">  </dv-cite>

<h2 id="sapiens"> Study B: the effect of social network structure on collective innovation </h2>

<p> When we talk about human culture, things like art, science and language, we often tend to emphasize the contributions of
    certain innovative individuals. This "lonely genius" narrative obscures the true, collective nature of human culture:
    from hunter-gatherers tens of thousands of years ago <dt-cite key="migliano_origins_2022"> </dt-cite> to today's
    research networks, humans innovate in groups. They observe innovations in their own past and their social
    environment and recombine them to form new innovations that in their turn become the material forming future innovation.

<p> The two groups on the left and right of Figure ... are very different: they regard populations inhabiting different
    temporal and spatial scales. The activities they regard however (art and technology for the cultural networks of Africa
    and science for the contemporary research network) share some similarities: they are both processes of collective
    innovation. When we glance at them, we get a very similar global picture of the social network structure: intense
    communication takes place in small clusters and some long-range connections ensure that some information travels to
    far-away clusters. Is this a coincidence or can we attribute this similarity in social network structure to common
    properties of these networks?
</p>

<h3> Background in HBE </h3>

<p> Understanding how the social environment affects the behavior of human groups is an important objective
    in fields studying human decision-making, such as psychology, cognitive science and archeology
    <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="masonPropagationInnovationsNetworked2008"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="masonCollaborativeLearningNetworks2012"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="fang_balancing_2010"> </dt-cite>. Such an understanding would help in two distinct ways: a) it would
    help us analyze the history of our own species, where many major events were contingent on the social network
    structure and, in general, the ecology of populations. Why did most first human civilisations appear on the same latitude?
    Why did Europe have the most advanced war technology in the 16th century? b) it would help us anticipate the future:
    if we know which social network structure is most appropriate for best-responding to a problem
    then we can organize our human resources appropriately. Such questions are often asked for example in organizational
    management research <dt-cite key="fang_balancing_2010"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> Early on, studies confirmed that there is something about the social network structure that affects the behavior of
    groups: in more densely connected groups information propagates quicker so that the group becomes homogeneous,
    while partially-connected groups can maintain some diversity of information in different sub-clusters. This makes these
    two broad categories of social network structures appropriate for different types of problems:
    easy problems (ones with a single and obvious solution) are most efficiently solved when
    the group is densely connected. Difficult problems, on the other hand, (ones where the optimal solution is hidden
    among many sub-optimal solutions) are better solved by partially-connected groups.
</p>

<p> What type of problem is cultural innovation? The landscape of innovation has a multi-level structure, where previous
    solutions become the material for new solutions. At the same time, newly discovered solutions are more interesting and
    likely to lead to new solutions, which biases innovation towards a forward march. Both these properties were captured
    by an influential study of human innovation <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"> </dt-cite>, where
    two types of groups (a fully-connected and a partially-connected) competed on an innovation task inspired from drug
    discovery.
</p>

</div>
</div>

<p> In this task, one starts with a set of elements which they can combine in triplets. Some triplets are valid, in the
    sense that they lead to the creation of a new element and incur a reward. Once the player finds a valid triplet, they
    can use the newly created element to then search for a new valid triplet. Triplets belong to one of two trajectories,
    the blue and the red: elements discovered in a trajectory are only useful for it. This means that once you find a valid
    triplet you are incentivised to stay in the same trajectory. But there is a catch: when you reach the fourth element,
    you need an element from the other trajectory. This is what makes this task deceptive: to solve it optimally
    (get ...) you need to act sub-optimally in the short-term (explore the other trajectory instead of just marching
    forward).
</p>

<h3> Background in AI </h3>

<p> Artificial agents search in collectives too. In RL, training the agents on learning to solve a task requires immense
    amounts of data. These data are collected by interacting with an environment, a computationally expensive process that
    becomes more manageable if one parallelizes the algorithm. By having multiple agents collecting data in their own copy
    of the environment and delivering them to a central node that trains the policy, we can achieve a reduction in training
    time linear to the number of agents. This is the paradigm of decentralized RL, which is so prominent that today, the most
    popular RL algorithms are not a single agent but a group of agents
    <dt-cite key="mnihAsynchronousMethodsDeep2016a"></dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="horganDistributedPrioritizedExperience2018"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="espeholt_impala_2018"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> This architecture where multiple workers communicate with a central learner that updates a single policy and returns
    it back to them is called a star topology and is, if not the only, the most prominent architecture used in
    decentralized RL. We hypothesize that the reason this choice dominated is that designers believe that this
    fully-connected architecture is best for sample complexity: the more information the agents in the group have the
    better, right?
</p>

<p> Having read our review of human studies, you too must be thinking that the answer to this question may not
    necessarily be "yes". In the next sub-section, we will describe our study of the effect of social network structure in
    distributed RL where the group is solving a task inspired by
    <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"></dt-cite>.  </p>

<h3> SAPIENS: a distributed RL framework with structured groups </h3>

<p> SAPIENS is a learning framework belonging to the decentralized RL learning paradigm that connects multiple
    learners based on a pre-defined social network structure. One can imagine many instantiations of it that differ for
    example in the learning algorithm employed and the type of information shared. In this project, we have studied a
    single instantiation with DQN learners that share experience tuples from their replay buffer.

<p>  Schematic of a SAPIENS algorithm with 2 DQN learners exchanging experiences from their replay buffer.
</p>
</div>

<p> We studied five different social network structures: fully-connected, ring, small-world (which we designed according
    to the Watts-Strogatz model) and dynamic. In the latter, the agents start in sub-groups of two and during training
    may visit other subgroups wiht probability <var> p <sub>v </var>  for a duration of <var> T <sub>v </var> time steps.

<i> </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<h3> Designing innovation tasks </h3>

<p> To study innovation, we want create tasks that have the multi-level structure that we described. We also want to be
flexible: we would like to try innovation tasks that vary in the length of the innovation path-ways (how many elements
    do we want the agents to create?) and the learning challenge involved (what challengs does a single or multiple learners
    face when trying to reach the maximum innovation level?).
</p>

<p> To achieve this we employed Wordcraft <dt-cite key="jiangWordCraftEnvironmentBenchmarking2020"> </dt-cite>,
    a test-bed inspired from the Little Alchemy game. Wordcraft was originally introduced to capture the common-sense
    abilities of RL agents: the innovation tasks were creating by quering a database in natural language that indicates
    which combinations of elements are possible in our human world (for example you can combine `fire` with 'water' to make
    'steam' but it does not make sense to combine 'fire' with 'rock').  Our project had a different objective: we want to
    create innovation tasks that pose different challenges but are not necessarily real-world objects. For this reason,
    we created three custom tasks with symbolic elements:
    <ul>
    <li> <b> single-path  task </b>:a task with a single innovation path to an easy-to-find global optimum.
        This type of task can be used to model a linear innovation structure, such as the evolution of the fork from
        knife to having, two-, three- and, eventually four tines, and is not a deceptive task.
    </li>
    <li>  <b> merging-paths task</b>: a task with two paths that individually lead to local optima, but when combined,
        can merge toward the global optimum. Inspired from previous studies in cognitive science this task we can capture
        innovations that were repurposed after their invention, such as Gutenberg's screw press leading to the print
        press.}
    </li>
    <li> <b> best-of-ten paths task</b>: \item a task with ten paths, only one of which leads to the global optimum,
        which captures search in vast spaces
    </li>

    </ul>

<h3> Observing different social network structures in different innovation tasks
</h3>

<p> Do the different social network structures behave differently, and do these differences depend on the task at hand?
This is the main question that we aimed to address with our empirical analysis. We evaluated performance in terms of two
    metrics: the maximum reward within the group after convergence (<var> R <sub>max </var>) and the time it took it to
    reach this performance (<var> T<sub>+</var>). In addition to the SAPIENS methods, we also benchmarked a group without
    sharing, a single agent and two distributed RL algorithms with a star topology: Ape-X
    <dt-cite key="horganDistributedPrioritizedExperience2018"> </dt-cite> and A2C
    <dt-cite key="mnihAsynchronousMethodsDeep2016a"> </dt-cite>. The results are summarised in the following figure:
</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/combined.svg" style="width:90%" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> Our analysis showed that:
<ul>
    <li> In the <b> single-path task</b>: there was no important differences between the structures. Interestingly, more
        sharing did not lead to quicker convergence. Instead, the fully-connected structure was the slowest to converge.
    </li>
    <li> In the <b> merging-paths task</b>: the dynamic structure was the most successful among all partially-connected
        structures and all fully-connected methods failed.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <b> best-of-ten-paths task</b>: the dynamics structure was again the most succcesful method.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3> Discussion </h3>

<p> In this work we showed that the social network structure of RL agents matters and that dynamic structures perform best
across different tasks. We believe that the contribution of this study is two-fold.
</p>

<p> From the perspective of distributed RL,
we showed that dynamic social network structures are worth-exploring as they perform better than the classicaly employed
star topology and that evaluating algorithms not just in terms of rewards, but also in terms of mnemonice properties
such as diversity, can contribute to understanding differences in the behaviors of different algorithms.</p>

<p> From the perspective of studies of human collective innovation, we showed that using RL agents as the computational model
    can enable the study of more complex problems, similar to the ones employed in human lab studies, and that the emerging
    behaviors confirm hypotheses from such studies. By studying a wider diversity of tasks that what has been considered in
    human studies, we were able to provide more hypotheses for future human studies.</p>




<h2> Overall conclusion </h2>

<p> With these two works we showed how our research methodology can benefit two very different fields: we started from
hypotheses from ecology, designed computational studies inspired from them and derived empirical conclusions that can feed
future studies in ecology.
</p>

<h2> Future work: how does environmental variability affect collective innovation by influencing social network structure?
</h2>

Despite this attention, however, the question of how firms can better maintain the balance of exploration and exploitation remains unresolved. Drawing on a wide range of research on population and organization structure, we argue that an organization divided into semi-isolated subgroups may help strike this balance. We simulate such an organization, systematically varying the interaction pattern between individuals to explore how the degree of subgroup isolation and inter-group connectivity influences organizational learning. We also test this model with a range of contingency variables highlighted in the management research. We find that moderate levels of cross-group linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across groups without reducing organizational diversity too quickly. This finding is remarkably resilient to a wide range of variance in factors such as problem complexity, environmental dynamism, and personnel turnover.},

	title = {Grounding an Ecological Theory of Artificial Intelligence in Human Evolution},
	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03446961},
	abstract = {Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revived the quest for agents able to acquire an open-ended repertoire of skills. Although this ability is fundamentally related to the characteristics of human intelligence, research in this field rarely considers the processes and ecological conditions that may have guided the emergence of complex cognitive capacities during the evolution of the species. Research in Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) seeks to understand how the behaviors characterizing human nature can be conceived as adaptive responses to major changes in our ecological niche. In this paper, we propose a framework highlighting the role of environmental complexity in open-ended skill acquisition, grounded in major hypotheses from HBE and recent contributions in Reinforcement learning (RL). We use this framework to highlight fundamental links between the two disciplines, as well as to identify feedback loops that bootstrap ecological complexity and create promising research directions for AI researchers. We also present our first steps towards designing a simulation environment that implements the climate dynamics necessary for studying key HBE hypotheses relating environmental complexity to skill acquisition.},

	shorttitle = {Quality {Diversity}},
	url = {https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040},
	abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet, evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms (e.g., novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},
