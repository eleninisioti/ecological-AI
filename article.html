<h1>An ecological approach to  Artificial Intelligence </h1>
<h2 id='subtitle'> How the field of ecology helped us conceptualize skill acquisition and design studies in AI</h2>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">

</div>

<p> 'Can machines think?' When Turing posed this question in his seminal paper
    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1951-02887-001"> Computing machinery and intelligence </a>
    <dt-cite key="turing_computing_1950"> </dt-cite> in the '50s,  he inadvertently laid the ground for what was to
    become the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ground was set firmly: generations of researchers have been
    searching for the cognitive architectures and optimization objectives that, when evaluated on carefully selected benchmarks, will lead to agents
    whose behavior is similar, or even improves upon, human behavior. Chess, video games and Go, are the carrots on a stick that
    have been driving the AI community forward.
</p>

<p> We call this the <em> cognition-centric </em> approach and want to contrast it to the <em> ecological </em>
        approach. Under this alternative attitude towards creating AI, intelligence is viewed as an emergent product
        of adaptive systems interacting with their environments. While cognition-centric approaches attempt to reverse-engineer
    intelligent behavior by searching in the space of cognitive functions, ecological approaches search in the space of
    environmental properties to reverse-engineer the conditions that drive intelligent behavior.
</p>


<p> Ecological perspectives abide in the study of biological organisms.
    From the emergence of vision systems <dt-cite key="gibson__2014"> </dt-cite>
    to that of religion <dt-cite key="botero_ecology_2014"> </dt-cite>, the environments encountered in the
    evolutionary trajectory of a species can help us understand why certain functions persist over others.
    If we look at the evolution of our own species, we will find that many behaviors that we consider simple,
    like using language and tools, took the longest time to evolve.
    Once a new skill was acquired, it also acted as a driver and enabler for new skills.
</p>

<p> The cognition-centric approach has recently given us many successful algorithms and applications.
    But it may have kept us busy on a research agenda that does not lead to artificial intelligence with the distinctive
    characteristics of a natural one.
    Machine learning algorithms are today criticised for being data-hungry, brittle when encountering new problems
    and morally disconnected from the human society that gave birth to them.
</p>



<p> In this blog post, we will discuss how we could pursue an ecological approach to AI.
    Our first objective is to get the big picture of how research in AI can be guided by our understanding of human
    intelligence.
    Our second objective is to see how this understanding can be useful in practice for AI studies.

	abstract = {Although ecological forces are known to shape the expression of sociality across a broad range of biological taxa, their role in shaping human behavior is currently disputed. Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91\%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.},
