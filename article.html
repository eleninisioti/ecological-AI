<h1>Ecological Artificial Intelligence </h1>
<h2 id='subtitle'> Grounding Artificial Intelligence in the Origins of Human Behavior </h2>


<p> 'Can machines think?' When Turing posed this question in his seminal paper
    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1951-02887-001"> Computing machinery and intelligence </a>
    <dt-cite key="turing_computing_1950"> </dt-cite> in the '50s,  he inadvertently laid the ground for what was to
    become the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ground was set firmly: generations of researchers have been
    engineering cognitive architectures and introducing objective functions that we evaluate on carefully selected
    benchmarks, abiding to the Turing-test tradition. </p>

<p> We call this the <em> cognition-centric </em> approach and want to contrast it to the <em> ecological </em>
        approach. Under this alternative attitude towards creating AI, intelligence is viewed as an emergent product
        of adaptive systems interacting with their environments. While cognition-centric approaches attempt to reverse-engineer
    intelligent behavior by searching in the space of cognitive functions, ecological approaches search in the space of
    environmental properties to reverse-engineer the conditions that drive intelligent behavior.
</p>

    <p> Ecological perspectives abide in the study of biological organisms. From the emergence of vision systems <a
            href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315740218/ecological-approach-visual-perception-james-gibson">
        (Gibson et al) </a> to that of religious beliefs
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=the+ecology+of+religious+beliefs"> Botero et
        al </a>, the environments encountered in a species' evolutionary trajectory have been used to explain why
        certain functions persist over others.
    </p>

    <h4> In this blog post, we will discuss why and how we should pursue an ecological approach to AI. In particular, we will: </h4>


    <ul>
        <li > <b> review recent progress and challenges in cognition-centric AI </b> </li>
        <li > <b> present a conceptual framework for grounding an ecological approach to AI in Human
            Behavioral Ecology (HBE), a research field studying the evolution of humans in interaction with their environments</b> </li>
        <li > <b> illustrate how an ecological perspective to AI looks in practise through two of our recent
            computational studies. </b> </li>

<td style="text-align: center"> <h4>  How does environmental variability affect the evolution of adaptability? </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">   In a world with temporal and spatial variability, a population of agents evolves its adaptability
        in order to survive. Agents can adapt using evolvability and phenotypic plasticity and the fittest ones in a
        niche leave offspring. Can these agents survive in the face of extreme climatic variability? In this work,
        we will see how populations adapt, diversify and disperse under different climatic conditions. </p></td>
<td style="text-align: center"> <h4> How does social connectivity affect collective innovation? </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">  From drug discovery to music composition, our human cultural repertoire relies on innovations produced
    by collectives that jointly explore, communicate and recombine solutions. Can artificial agents also innovate in
    collectives? In the learning paradigm of distributed RL, groups of agents solve tasks in parallel and share their
    experiences with observed benefits to performance. But, while biological organisms exhibit a variety of social
    network structures,, distributed RL agents always share with everyone. Here, we study the effect of social network
    structure in a group of DQN agents playing the <a href='https://littlealchemy2.com/'> Little Alchemy game </a>.

<p> At a first glance these two studies have nothing in common, except perhaps for their ecological attitude towards
    skill acquisition. At the end of this post we will see, however, that there is room for exchanging ideas between
    the two: recent ecological theories posit that elements in our environment such as the Sahara desert act as
    ecological barriers that prohibit immigration but can disappear during periods of extreme climatic variability
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQP-7BPvvq0"> did you know the Sahara was green a few tens of thousands
        of years ago?  </a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076514">
        (Larrasoana et al) </a>. This means that climatic variability may have affected social network structure,
    with interesting implications for the populations that needed to survive at the time  ...
</p>

    <h2 id="open-ended-skills-in"> Open-ended skills in biological and artificial agents </h2>

    <p> What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "open-endedness"? For many scientists,
        engineers and artists, it is "life" or "evolution", words that conjure images of biological agents with a wide
        diversity of forms and functions, entangled in a complex web of interactions. What makes biological
        open-endedness particularly mind-boggling is not just the diversity and complexity of solutions, but the
        apparent simplicity of the algorithm that continuously gives rise to them: evolution. </p>

    <p> AI researchers were also inspired from the open-endedness of biological evolution and attempted to imitate it by
        building artificial agents with large behavioral repertoires. Largely owing to achievements in deep learning,
        optimization using  reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms managed to produce agents with impressive
        behavioral repertoires:  populations of RL agents co-adapting with their environments managed to develop
        morphologies that can walk on challenging terrains <a href="/www.uber.com/en-FR/blog/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/"> (Wang et
        al) </a>, a single RL agent trained using techniques developed for language models managed to play Atari games,
        chat and control a robotic arm <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent"> (Reed et
            al) </a> [](), a team of RL agents playing Hide-and-Seek learned how to manipulate items in their
        environment to continuously pose new challenges to another team <a href="https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/"> (Baker et
        al) </a>  and evolutionary algorithms that optimize for both diversity and quality managed to solve deceptive
        maze-navigation tasks <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040/full"> (Pugh et
            al) </a>. Today, open-ended skill acquisition is considered an important pursuit in AI for driving the
        field forward <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/">(Stanley et al,

We explore the resilience of autopoietic patterns–their ability to recover from shocks or perturbations–in a simplified form in Conway's Game of Life. We subject a large number of autopoietic patterns in the Game of Life to various perturbations, and record their responses using multiple resilience metrics. Our results show that while resilience is rare, we are able to identify structural features improving patterns' resilience. We also draw several parallels between the resilience of patterns in the Game of Life to real-world complex systems.

abstract={Morphological regeneration is an important feature that highlights the environmental adaptive capacity of biological systems. Lack of this regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

Recent developments in NCAs lie in the 2D domain, namely reconstructing target images from a single pixel or infinitely growing 2D textures. In this work, we propose an extension of NCAs to 3D, utilizing 3D convolutions in the proposed neural network architecture. Minecraft is selected as the environment for our automaton since it allows the generation of both static structures and moving machines. We show that despite their simplicity, NCAs are capable of growing complex entities such as castles, apartment blocks, and trees, some of which are composed of over 3,000 blocks. Additionally, when trained for regeneration, the system is able to regrow parts of simple functional machines, significantly expanding the capabilities of simulated morphogenetic systems.

  	Abstract = {This article examines in some technical detail the application of Maturana and Varela s biology of cognition to a simple concrete model: a glider in the game of Life cellular automaton. By adopting an autopoietic perspective on a glider, the set of possible perturbations to it can be divided into destructive and nondestructive subsets. From a glider s reaction to each nondestructive perturbation, its cognitive domain is then mapped. In addition, the structure of a glider s possible knowledge of its immediate environment, and the way in which that knowledge is grounded in its constitution, are fully described. The notion of structural coupling is then explored by characterizing the paths of mutual perturbation that a glider and its environment can undergo. Finally, a simple example of a communicative interaction between two gliders is given. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of this analysis for the enactive approach to cognition.},

    abstract = {Abstract The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the direction of heavier, substrate-deforming, but chemically inert masses. This long-range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that is distorted above a threshold substrate strain—a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to make long-range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.},

    abstract = {Soft robots have become increasingly popular in recent years -- and justifiably so.
    Their compliant structures and (theoretically) infinite degrees of freedom allow them
    to undertake tasks which would be impossible for their rigid body counterparts, such
    as conforming to uneven surfaces, efficiently distributing stress, and passing through
    small apertures. Previous work in the automated deign of soft robots has shown examples
    of these squishy creatures performing traditional robotic task like locomoting over
    flat ground. However, designing soft robots for traditional robotic tasks fails to
    fully utilize their unique advantages. In this work, we present the first example
    of a soft robot evolutionarily designed for reaching or squeezing through a small
    aperture -- a task naturally suited to its type of morphology. We optimize these creatures
    with the CPPN-NEAT evolutionary algorithm, introducing a novel implementation of the
    algorithm which includes multi-objective optimization while retaining its speciation
    feature for diversity maintenance. We show that more compliant and deformable soft
    robots perform more effectively at this task than their less flexible counterparts.
    This work serves mainly as a proof of concept, but we hope that it helps to open the
    door for the better matching of tasks with appropriate morphologies in robotic design
    in the future.},

    abstract = {Soft robots allow for interesting morphological and behavioral designs because they exhibit more degrees of freedom than robots composed of rigid parts. In particular, voxel-based soft robots (VSRs)—aggregations of elastic cubic building blocks—have attracted the interest of Robotics and Artificial Life researchers. VSRs can be controlled by changing the volume of individual blocks: simple, yet effective controllers that do not exploit the feedback of the environment, have been automatically designed by means of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).In this work we explore the possibility of evolving sensing controllers in the form of artificial neural networks: we hence allow the robot to sense the environment in which it moves. Although the search space for a sensing controller is larger than its non-sensing counterpart, we show that effective sensing controllers can be evolved which realize interesting locomotion behaviors. We also experimentally investigate the impact of the VSR morphology on the effectiveness of the search and verify that the sensing controllers are indeed able to exploit their sensing ability for better solving the locomotion task.},

Using a thought experiment involving a fictitious dynamical systems model of the biosphere we argue that the metabolism, motility, and the concept of counterfactual variation should be compatible with any agent representation in dynamical systems. We then propose an information theoretic notion of integrated spatiotemporal patterns which we believe can serve as the basic building block of an agent definition. We argue that these patterns are capable of solving the problems mentioned before. We also test this in some preliminary experiments.},

While previous studies have shown that evolutionary robotics techniques can be applied to obtain robust and efficient self-organized behaviors for robot swarms, most studies have been conducted in simulation, and the few that have been conducted on real robots have been confined to laboratory environments. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a swarm robotics system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and uncontrolled environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in simulation for canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion, clustering, and monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers on a real swarm of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the evolved controllers transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a performance similar to the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that the evolved controllers display key properties of swarm intelligence-based control, namely scalability, flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in which the swarm performs a complete environmental monitoring task by combining multiple evolved controllers.},

A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial configuration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area `covered' by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-field-based approach to deployment. The fields are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.",

abstract = {Abstract Background: Embryonic development can often adjust its morphogenetic processes to counteract external perturbation. The existence of self-monitoring responses during pattern formation is of considerable importance to the biomedicine of birth defects, but has not been quantitatively addressed. To understand the computational capabilities of biological tissues in a molecularly tractable model system, we induced craniofacial defects in Xenopus embryos, then tracked tadpoles with craniofacial deformities and used geometric morphometric techniques to characterize changes in the shape and position of the craniofacial structures. Results: Canonical variate analysis revealed that the shapes and relative positions of perturbed jaws and branchial arches were corrected during the first few months of tadpole development. Analysis of the relative movements of the anterior-most structures indicates that misplaced structures move along the anterior–posterior and left–right axes in ways that are significantly different from their normal movements. Conclusions: Our data suggest a model in which craniofacial structures use a measuring mechanism to assess and adjust their location relative to other local organs. Understanding the correction mechanisms at work in this system could lead to the better understanding of the adaptive decision-making capabilities of living tissues and suggest new approaches to correct birth defects in humans.
