<h1>An ecological approach to  Artificial Intelligence </h1>
<h2 id='subtitle'> How the field of ecology helped us conceptualize skill acquisition and design studies in AI</h2>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
  <img src="public/introblog_ecoAI.png" alt="scheme" style="width:120%">
</div>

<p> 'Can machines think?' When Turing posed this question in his seminal paper
    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1951-02887-001"> Computing machinery and intelligence </a>
    <dt-cite key="turing_computing_1950"> </dt-cite> in the '50s,  he inadvertently laid the ground for what was to
    become the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ground was set firmly: generations of researchers have been
    searching for the cognitive architectures and optimization objectives that, when evaluated on carefully selected benchmarks, will lead to agents
    whose behavior is similar, or even improves upon, human behavior. Chess, video games and Go, are the carrots on a stick that
    have been driving the AI community forward.
</p>

<p> We call this the <em> cognition-centric </em> approach and want to contrast it to the <em> ecological </em>
        approach. Under this alternative attitude towards creating AI, intelligence is viewed as an emergent product
        of adaptive systems interacting with their environments. While cognition-centric approaches attempt to reverse-engineer
    intelligent behavior by searching in the space of cognitive functions, ecological approaches search in the space of
    environmental properties to reverse-engineer the conditions that drive intelligent behavior.
</p>


<p> Ecological perspectives abide in the study of biological organisms.
    From the emergence of vision systems <dt-cite key="gibson__2014"> </dt-cite>
    to that of religion <dt-cite key="botero_ecology_2014"> </dt-cite>, the environments encountered in the
    evolutionary trajectory of a species can help us understand why certain functions persist over others.
    If we look at the evolution of our own species, we will find that many behaviors that we consider simple,
    like using language and tools, took the longest time to evolve.
    Once a new skill was acquired, it also acted as a driver and enabler for new skills.
</p>

<p> The cognition-centric approach has recently given us many successful algorithms and applications.
    But it may have kept us busy on a research agenda that does not lead to artificial intelligence with the distinctive
    characteristics of a natural one.
    Machine learning algorithms are today criticised for being data-hungry, brittle when encountering new problems
    and morally disconnected from the human society that gave birth to them.
</p>



<p> In this blog post, we will discuss how we could pursue an ecological approach to AI.
    Our first objective is to get the big picture of how research in AI can be guided by our understanding of human
    intelligence.
    Our second objective is to see how this understanding can be useful in practice for AI studies.

<h2 id="framework"> A conceptual framework for linking human and artificial ecologies </h2>

<p> We recently proposed <dt-cite key="nisioti_grounding_2021"> </dt-cite> <dt-cite key="clement_thesis"> </dt-cite> that a possible pathway
    to getting artificial agents that exhibit the ability to continuously acquire skills in an open-ended way is to find inspiration in a biological
    species with an impressively open-ended behavioral repertoire: our own.
</p>


<p> Our methodology was three-step: </p>


<ol type="1">


    <li style="..."> skim the Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) literature to identify the key factors that this
        community proposes as conducive for the evolution of the uniquely diverse human cultural repertoire
</li>
    <li style="..."> identify similar research questions and hypotheses in AI, in particular the sub-fields of
        meta and multi-agent reinforcement learning
</li>
    <li style="..."> abstract away the particularities of the two fields to arrive at a  conceptual framework that
        unifies their terminologies and research agendas.
</li>

</ol>


<p> Here is our conceptual framework, <em> ORIGINS </em>, that our work led to: </p>



<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/framework.png" height="465" width="665" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
    <i> <em> ORIGINS </em> is conceptual framework for studying skill acquisition in both human and artificial ecologies. </i></sub>
</div>
</div>



<p> The story that the framework tells, put succinctly, is:
</p>

<p> <em> Environmental complexity  has a key role in  skill acquisition.
    It bootstraps the emergence of skills at both an individual and a collective level.
    At an individual level, it modulates reproduction pressures and creates the need for cognitive mechanisms.
    At a collective level, cooperation and competition pressures drive the need for social skills.
    The skills themselves then act as drivers for further skill acquisition in two ways:
    a) they interact with each other to give rise to the uniquely complex human cultural repertoire b)  they modulate
    environmental complexity through the process of niche construction.
    It is this latter process that makes skill acquisition open-ended, as it creates a positive feedback loop that
continuously complexifies the environment.</em> </p>

<p> <em> ORIGINS </em>  can be a useful tool for both AI and HBE communities:  AI researchers can borrow existing hypotheses from
    HBE about which environmental conditions affect which skills to appropriately shape their environments. At the same time, HBE researchers can use AI as a computational tool
    for studying their hypotheses.</p>

<p> In the rest of the post we describe two of our projects that can be seen as following the ecological approach we are proposing.
    We will zoom-in in different parts of the conceptual framework, discuss the ecological hypotheses they were inspired from,
    and explain the computational models we designed to study them.
</p>

<h2 id="Study-A"> Evolution of adaptability in complex environments </h2>

<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> Earth: the apparent genomic diversity of species in our planet could not have existed without an equally impressive diversity of ecological niches.</i></sub>
</div>
</div>


<p> What makes us human? For HBE researchers, this is not a philosophical inquiry, but a rather pressing scientific
    question: why did the first hominin species appear about 5 million years ago and which skills did they evolve
    that allowed them to expand into a  population that today holds a powerful position in the Earth's  ecosystem?</p>

<p> When we trace back the history of our planet, we find climatic records of very ''busy" periods : many rapid and
    large-amplitude climatic cycles have taken place in the last few million years, leading to high levels of climate
    change that must have significantly shaped populations at a global and local scale. Our own species appeared
    and dispersed during such periods
    <dt-cite key="maslin_synthesis_2015"> </dt-cite> <dt-cite key="sanchez_goni_regional_2020"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="potts_hominin_2013"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> Could there be a link between this climatic complexity and the birth of one of the most generalist species?
Understanding the mechanisms with which temporal and spatial diversity in an environment influences individuals and populations
    is a crucial step towards answering this question.
</p>.

<p> A similar story has been unfolding in AI, where the first impressive agents were extremely specialized, solving a single task like Chess.
    But recently, the focus is on generalist agents that can adapt to changes in tasks that they have never encountered during their design.
</p>

<p> The consensus of the community is that, when it comes to creating generalist agents,
    the environments used for training play a big part.
    In meta-learning <dt-cite key="vanschoren_meta-learning_2018"> </dt-cite>, the focus is on ensuring a wide diversity of environments.
    In curriculum learning <dt-cite key="vanschoren_meta-learning_2018"> </dt-cite> the focus is on the order in which environments are encountered,
as the training procedure needs to ensure that agents are continuously challenged but are able to improve.

<p>
These are the ideas that motivated the computational study we describe next <dt-cite key="nisioti_plasticity_2022"> </dt-cite>,
    where we attempt to understand how the complexity of environments,
    both in terms of their temporal dynamics and task diversity, acts as a driver for generalism.

<h3> An eco-evo-devo study of the emergence of generalist agents</h3>

<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i>  An agent with low plasticity (on the left) has small &sigma; and a high peak at their preferred niche, while a
    plastic individual (on the right) has large &sigma; and a lower peak at their preferred niche. Fitness in a
    certain environmental state is computed as the probability density function of the distribution at that point
the plastic individual has lower fitness (cost of plasticity). If the actual environmental state differs
    significantly from the preferred one the plastic individual has higher fitness.
</i> </sub>

</div>

<h4> The model </h4>

<p> In this project we designed an environment that exhibits both temporal and spatial diversity in terms of resource availability.
    The amount of resources depends on the latitude of a niche and a climate function that changes with time.
    Agents have three ways to adapt to their environment, all encoded in their genome: a preferred environmental state,
    phenotypic plasticity and a mutation rate.
    Thus, agents can adapt at two time-scales: phenotypic plasticity is a developmental mechanism that enables survival
    in diverse environments within
    a single lifetime, while mutations enable adaptation at a slower, evolutionary time-scale.
</p>

<p> To model phenotypic plasticity  we have adopted tolerance curves, a tool originally  developed in ecology  <dt-cite key="grove_evolution_2014"> </dt-cite>.
    Tolerance curves have the form of a Gaussian whose mean corresponds to the preferred environmental state of an individual and
    variance to its plasticity, i.e., its ability to survive under different environmental conditions. </p>


<p> Tolerance curves elegantly capture the cost and benefit of plasticity: if a plastic and non-plastic agent compete
    in an environment that is identical to their preferred niche, the plastic one will lose as its peak is lower. But
    if, for some reason, the environment changes in the next generation so that it differs significantly from the preferred niche
    of the two individuals, the plastic one will be at an advantage.
</p>

<!--<p> The world consists of a number of niches N and a climate function that shows how the state of all niches changes with time.-->
<!--The state of a niche at a given generation depends on the value of the climate function and the latitude of the niches,-->
<!--with southern niches having better states.</p>-->


<p> At each generation, an agent surviving in a niche can reproduce until the capacity of the niche is filled.
    Agents are chosen based on their fitness, which depends on their preferred state, their plasticity and the state of the niche.
    If an agent can survive in multiple niches it will be eligible for reproduction in all of them, and thus, will have higher chances of reproducing.
    We refer to this selection mechanism as <i> niche-limited competition </i>.
    We also compared against a condition where selection does not happen independently in each niche, but agents compete against everyone based on their average
    fitness across all niches.
    This condition corresponds to survival-of-the-fittest, the most widely used evolutionary algorithm.
</p>

<h4> Results </h4>
<p> Here is an illustration of how the population behaves in a world with 100 niches and a climate function that has the
    form of a sinusoid when the selection mechanism is niche-limited competition:</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">

<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i>  Illustration of a simulation in our environment. The population evolves under niche-limited competition in an environment where south niches have higher
    quality than norther niches.
</i>
</sub>
</div>
</div>


<p> In this study we saw that adaptability emerges when the number of niches is large or when there is temporal
    variability.
    We also saw that some environmental conditions and selection pressures may favor plasticity, while others favor
    evolvability.
    Our study suggests to the AI community that environmental conditions play an important part in the emergence and form of generalism.
    Even if the algorithm is powerful enough to behave as a generalist, this behavior will not emerge if the spatiotemporal dynamics of the environments
    do not require it.
    We also saw that limiting competition within niches is an important driver of generalism, at a time when most meta RL works use survival-of-the-fittest.
</p>

<!--<h4> Next steps </h4>-->
<p>
Do our conclusions generalize to meta-RL agents?
Transferring our computational study to a grounded environment, where plasticity
is not hard-coded but emerges out of a behavioral policy is an important next step towards showcasing the importance of
ecological dynamics.
For this reason we implemented a large-scale environment, where populations of thousands of agents can forage resources
    in a grid-world with resource density that varies in space and time <dt-cite key="gautier2023EcoevolutionaryDynamicsNonepisodic"> </dt-cite>
</p>

<p> We now zoom-out of the link between environmental dynamics and adaptability in our conceptual framework and move our gaze to the right.
    There we meet the cultural repertoire, a set of rather advanced skills that presuppose the existence of both individual cognitive mechanisms and social dynamics.
    Next, we will describe a study how multi-agent dynamics influence the formation of a cultural repertoire.

Does this pattern suggest a link between social connectivity and the ability to innovate collectively?
</i>
</sub>
</div>

<p> Culture, the ability to create and spread traditions through social learning, is often seen as a monopoly of our own species.
    But there are many species that learn through others <dt-cite key="whiten1999CulturesChimpanzees"> </dt-cite>.
    Few of them can change their cultural skills with time <dt-cite key="tyarks2022ChangesHumpbackWhale"> </dt-cite>.
    Some species can even accumulate changes with time, which leads to a continuous “complexification” of their skills <dt-cite key="sasaki2017CumulativeCultureCan"> </dt-cite>.
    What is unique in humans, however, is the intensity of accumulation.
    From programming languages to musical instruments <dt-cite key="solee2013EvolutionaryEcologyTechnological"> </dt-cite>, the fossil record of human innovations has a rather intricate, tree structure, with new innovations arising out
    of recombination of existing ones.
</p>


<p> Why do humans innovate to such an unprecendented degree?
    Some theories point to our increased cognitive capacity or sociality <dt-cite key="klinePopulationSizePredicts2010"> </dt-cite>.
    But others point to the benefits of our social connectivity: human societies often self-organize into small-world, hierarchical or dynamic
    topologies. The common feature underlying those is their ability to protect information within sub-parts of the group.
    In this way, the group maintains its cultural diversity, and it is this diversity that may be driving the continuous appearance of innovations.
</p>



<p> Reinforcement learning, the sub-field of AI concerned with learning by interacting with an environment,
    is also interested in the benefits of collective exploration.
    In distributed RL, multiple agents solve a task in parallel and exchange information on the way <dt-cite key="mnihAsynchronousMethodsDeep2016a"></dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="horganDistributedPrioritizedExperience2018"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="espeholt_impala_2018"> </dt-cite>.
    This has shown benefits both in terms of the quality of the final solution and the speed at which it is discovered.
</p>

<p> Yet this community has considered a single type of group connectivity, the star topology:
all agents interact with the environment to collect information and then share it with a single central node responsible for
    processing the new information and updating the behavior of the agents.
    Thus, artificial groups look very different from the partially-connected human groups.
    If this structure reduces their collective diversity, it may negatively impact the ability of these groups to solvex innovation challenges.
</p>


<p>
    This is the idea that motivated the computational study we describe next <dt-cite key="nisioti2022SocialNetworkStructure"> </dt-cite>,
    where groups of RL agents solve innovation tasks under different topologies.

<h4> The model </h4>

<p> To study innovation we employed Wordcraft <dt-cite key="jiangWordCraftEnvironmentBenchmarking2020"> </dt-cite>,
    an RL text-world inspired from the Little Alchemy 2 game.
    The player starts with a set of elements, for example "fire", "water" and "earth" and can combine them in pairs to craft new elements.
    Not all combinations give rise to new elements; the description of a task includes a list of the possible combinations.

<i> Visualization of our innovation tasks

</div>

<p> We were interested in studying a variety of challenges a group can encounter when solving innovation tasks, so we designed
    three different tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> the single-path task, where new innovations arise as modifications of the most recent past innovations.
        Search is easy in this type of task.
        The challenge lies in solving it as quickly as possible.
        We are therefore interested in the speed at which groups innovate.
        This task can be used to model arms races, such as the invention of aircrafts and their continuous improvement to machine gun-mounted planes like
        the Fokker during the First World War.
    </li>
    <li> the merging-paths task, where two identical paths merge into a more rewarding path.
        This task contains a strong local optima: to find the more rewarding path one needs to start exploring both other paths instead of reaching the end of one of them.
        It can be useful to model the recombination of innovations that often happens in technological progress, as for example in the evolution of gasoline.
        The distillation of petroleum can be seen as one innovation path, that gave us the inventions of kerosine and gasoline.
        Kerosine attracted a lot of attention but gasoline was ignored as a volatile by-product.
        This was until another innovation path gave us the internal combustion engine.
        In itself this engine was not very popular, but when combined with gasoline, it changed the world.
    </li>
    <li> the best-of-ten paths task, with nine identical paths and one path that is the most rewarding.
        Here, the challenge lies in exploring a large search space.
        Large search spaces are inherent in many fields of innovation, such as biology and medicine.
    </li>

</ul>

</div>

<p> In our experiments, a game is played by a group of RL agents.
    An RL agent embodies the paradigm of learning through trial and error.
    It interacts with an environment by executing <i> actions </i> and receiving <i> observations</i> and <i> rewards</i>.
    For example, in a Little Alchemy 2 task, an agent defines which elements it will combine and the environment returns the newly created elements and the points added to the player's score.
    The main idea in RL is that an agent can learn a policy that solves a task optimally if it is exposed to multiple trials of it and uses this experience to maximize
    the rewards it receives.

<p> The RL algorithm that we employed was DQN <dt-cite key="mnihPlayingAtariDeep"> </dt-cite>, a deep RL algorithm where
    an agent has an explicit memory of past experiences that is periodically sampled
    to update its policy.
    These experiences have the form <i> [observation, action, reward] </i> and are also employed for sharing information with others.
    When we say that an agent shares an experience with another agent we mean that it samples a random experiences from its memory
    and directly inserts it to the other's memory.
</p>

<p> An agent shares experiences only with its neighbors, which are determined by the social connectivity of the group.
In our study, we considered the following social connectivities:
</p>

<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> The social connectivities we studied empirically. The dynamic connectivity is inspired from a previous study in human
ecology <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"> </dt-cite></i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<h4> Results </h4>

<p>
Our empirical evaluation of the four types of social connectivites showed that fully-connected groups perform worse in all three tasks.
In the single-path task, they are the slowest to find the optimal solution.
In the merging-paths task, they converge to the local optima.
In the best-of-ten paths, they explore too slowly to discover the optimal path.
</p>

<p>
To explain these behaviors we measured the diversity of memories that agents have.
We observed that agents in fully-connected groups had high diversity as individuals, but the group as a whole had the lowest diversity.
Low diversity indicates that the group is collectively exploring a small party of the search space and can thus explain the failure of fully-connected groups.
</p>

<p> The animation below illustrates how a group with partial connectivity and full connectivity behave in the merging-paths task.
As we see, agents in fully-connected group end up all exploring the same branch and fail to discover the global optimum:

</div>

<p>
Do our empirical conclusions generalize to more complex environments, such as grid-worlds and Atari games?
And how can we use our new understanding to guide the design of social connectivity for improving performance in certain tasks?
These are examples of the research questions we plan to explore in future work.
</p>

<h2> Connecting the dots </h2>

<p> With these two works we showed how our research methodology can benefit two very different fields: we started from
hypotheses in ecology, designed computational studies inspired from them and derived empirical conclusions that can feed
future studies both in ecology and AI.
</p>

<p> At a first glance our two studies may seem disconnected.
    One is concerned with the effect of ecological dynamics on a populations' dispersal and adaptability and the other with
    the effect of social connectivity on collective innovation.
    But isn't the social connectivity of a a population related to its dispersal?
    This observation allows us to draw a link between ecological dynamics and collective innovation.
    Can certain ecological conditions favor certain social connectivities and what would this mean for the evolution of our species?
</p>

<p> This connection may not be far-fetched. Ecological studies posit that elements in our environment such as the Sahara desert act as
    ecological barriers that prohibit immigration but can disappear during periods of extreme climatic variability
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQP-7BPvvq0"> did you know the Sahara was green a few tens of thousands
        of years ago?  </a> <dt-cite key="larrasoana_dynamics_2013"> </dt-cite>.
    And studies of human cultural innovation posit that such barriers played an important part
    in the spread of cultural artifacts <dt-cite key="derricoIdentifyingEarlyModern2017"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> Would an artificial ecology with RL agents navigating a world with continents and oceans remind us of our own societies?

	abstract = {The archaeological record shows that typically human cultural traits emerged at different times, in different parts of the world, and among different hominin taxa. This pattern suggests that their emergence is the outcome of complex and nonlinear evolutionary trajectories, influenced by environmental, demographic, and social factors, that need to be understood and traced at regional scales. The application of predictive algorithms using archaeological and paleoenvironmental data allows one to estimate the ecological niches occupied by past human populations and identify niche changes through time, thus providing the possibility of investigating relationships between cultural innovations and possible niche shifts. By using such methods to examine two key southern Africa archaeological cultures, the Still Bay [76–71 thousand years before present (ka)] and the Howiesons Poort (HP; 66–59 ka), we identify a niche shift characterized by a significant expansion in the breadth of the HP ecological niche. This expansion is coincident with aridification occurring across Marine Isotope Stage 4 (
              ca.
              72–60 ka) and especially pronounced at 60 ka. We argue that this niche shift was made possible by the development of a flexible technological system, reliant on composite tools and cultural transmission strategies based more on “product copying” rather than “process copying.” These results counter the one niche/one human taxon equation. They indicate that what makes our cultures, and probably the cultures of other members of our lineage, unique is their flexibility and ability to produce innovations that allow a population to shift its ecological niche.},

	abstract = {Crucial questions in the debate on the origin of quintessential human behaviours are whether modern cognition and associated innovations are unique to our species and whether they emerged abruptly, gradually or as the result of a discontinuous process. Three scenarios have been proposed to account for the origin of cultural modernity. The first argues that modern cognition is unique to our species and the consequence of a genetic mutation that took place approximately 50 ka in Africa among already evolved anatomically modern humans. The second posits that cultural modernity emerged gradually in Africa starting at least 200 ka in concert with the origin of our species on that continent. The third states that innovations indicative of modern cognition are not restricted to our species and appear and disappear in Africa and Eurasia between 200 and 40 ka before becoming fully consolidated. We evaluate these scenarios in the light of new evidence from Africa, Asia and Europe and explore the mechanisms that may have led to modern cultures. Such reflections will demonstrate the need for further inquiry into the relationship between climate and demographic/cultural change in order to better understand the mechanisms of cultural transmission at work in Neanderthals and early

	abstract = {The diversity and quality of natural systems have been a puzzle and inspiration for communities studying artificial life. It is now widely admitted that the adaptation mechanisms enabling these properties are largely influenced by the environments they inhabit. Organisms facing environmental variability have two alternative adaptation mechanisms operating at different timescales: {\textbackslash}textit\{plasticity\}, the ability of a phenotype to survive in diverse environments and {\textbackslash}textit\{evolvability\}, the ability to adapt through mutations. Although vital under environmental variability, both mechanisms are associated with fitness costs hypothesized to render them unnecessary in stable environments. In this work, we study the interplay between environmental dynamics and adaptation in a minimal model of the evolution of plasticity and evolvability. We experiment with different types of environments characterized by the presence of niches and a climate function that determines the fitness landscape. We empirically show that environmental dynamics affect plasticity and evolvability differently and that the presence of diverse ecological niches favors adaptability even in stable environments. We perform ablation studies of the selection mechanisms to separate the role of fitness-based selection and niche-limited competition. Results obtained from our minimal model allow us to propose promising research directions in the study of open-endedness in biological and artificial systems.},

	abstract = {Current evidence suggests that all of the major events in hominin evolution have occurred in East Africa. Over the last two decades, there has been intensive work undertaken to understand African palaeoclimate and tectonics in order to put together a coherent picture of how the environment of East Africa has varied in the past. The landscape of East Africa has altered dramatically over the last 10 million years. It has changed from a relatively flat, homogenous region covered with mixed tropical forest, to a varied and heterogeneous environment, with mountains over 4 km high and vegetation ranging from desert to cloud forest. The progressive rifting of East Africa has also generated numerous lake basins, which are highly sensitive to changes in the local precipitation-evaporation regime. There is now evidence that the presence of precession-driven, ephemeral deep-water lakes in East Africa were concurrent with major events in hominin evolution. It seems the unusual geology and climate of East Africa created periods of highly variable local climate, which, it has been suggested could have driven hominin speciation, encephalisation and dispersal out of Africa. One example is the significant hominin speciation and brain expansion event at ∼1.8 Ma that seems to have been coeval with the occurrence of highly variable, extensive, deep-water lakes. This complex, climatically very variable setting inspired first the variability selection hypothesis, which was then the basis for the pulsed climate variability hypothesis. The newer of the two suggests that the long-term drying trend in East Africa was punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme humidity and aridity. Both hypotheses, together with other key theories of climate-evolution linkages, are discussed in this paper. Though useful the actual evolution mechanisms, which led to early hominins are still unclear and continue to be debated. However, it is clear that an understanding of East African lakes and their palaeoclimate history is required to understand the context within which humans evolved and eventually left East Africa.},

	abstract = {Investigations into how climate change shaped human evolution have begun to focus on environmental dynamics, i.e., the nature and tempo of climate and landscape variability, an approach that de-emphasizes static reconstructions of early hominin habitats. The interaction among insolation cycles is especially apparent in the paleoenvironmental records of the East African Rift System, where the longest records of human evolution are preserved. However, environmental indicators such as deep-sea oxygen isotopes, terrestrial dust ﬂux, paleosol carbon isotopes, and lake sediments do not point consistently to any simple trend or climate driver of evolutionary change. Comparison of environmental indicators cautions against an exclusive focus on any given end-member of environmental ﬂuctuation (driest or wettest, warmest or coolest), and argues for the impact of the entire range of variability in shaping evolutionary change. A model of alternating high and low climate variability for tropical Africa further implies that speciﬁc environmental indicators reﬂect different aspects of East African environmental dynamics. The model may thus help reconcile some of the conﬂicting interpretations about the environmental drivers of hominin evolution. First and last appearances of hominin lineages, benchmark biogeographic events, and the emergence of key adaptations and capacities to alter the surroundings are consistently concentrated in the predicted longest intervals of high climate variability. The view that emerges is that important changes in stone technology, sociality, and other aspects of hominin behavior can now be understood as adaptive responses to heightened habitat instability.},

	abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet, evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms (e.g., novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},

	abstract = {Although ecological forces are known to shape the expression of sociality across a broad range of biological taxa, their role in shaping human behavior is currently disputed. Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91\%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.},

	abstract = {Astronomically forced insolation changes have driven monsoon dynamics and recurrent humid episodes in North Africa, resulting in green Sahara Periods (GSPs) with savannah expansion throughout most of the desert. Despite their potential for expanding the area of prime hominin habitats and favouring out-of-Africa dispersals, GSPs have not been incorporated into the narrative of hominin evolution due to poor knowledge of their timing, dynamics and landscape composition at evolutionary timescales. We present a compilation of continental and marine paleoenvironmental records from within and around North Africa, which enables identification of over 230 GSPs within the last 8 million years. By combining the main climatological determinants of woody cover in tropical Africa with paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic data for representative (Holocene and Eemian) GSPs, we estimate precipitation regimes and habitat distributions during GSPs. Their chronology is consistent with the ages of Saharan archeological and fossil hominin sites. Each GSP took 2–3 kyr to develop, peaked over 4–8 kyr, biogeographically connected the African tropics to African and Eurasian mid latitudes, and ended within 2–3 kyr, which resulted in rapid habitat fragmentation. We argue that the well-dated succession of GSPs presented here may have played an important role in migration and evolution of hominins.},

abstract={Morphological regeneration is an important feature that highlights the environmental adaptive capacity of biological systems. Lack of this regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

    abstract = "{Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) have been proven effective in simulating morphogenetic processes, the continuous construction of complex structures from very few starting cells. Recent developments in NCAs lie in the 2D domain, namely reconstructing target images from a single pixel or infinitely growing 2D textures. In this work, we propose an extension of NCAs to 3D, utilizing 3D convolutions in the proposed neural network architecture. Minecraft is selected as the environment for our automaton since it allows the generation of both static structures and moving machines. We show that despite their simplicity, NCAs are capable of growing complex entities such as castles, apartment blocks, and trees, some of which are composed of over 3,000 blocks. Additionally, when trained for regeneration, the system is able to regrow parts of simple functional machines, significantly expanding the capabilities of simulated morphogenetic systems.

  	Abstract = {This article examines in some technical detail the application of Maturana and Varela s biology of cognition to a simple concrete model: a glider in the game of Life cellular automaton. By adopting an autopoietic perspective on a glider, the set of possible perturbations to it can be divided into destructive and nondestructive subsets. From a glider s reaction to each nondestructive perturbation, its cognitive domain is then mapped. In addition, the structure of a glider s possible knowledge of its immediate environment, and the way in which that knowledge is grounded in its constitution, are fully described. The notion of structural coupling is then explored by characterizing the paths of mutual perturbation that a glider and its environment can undergo. Finally, a simple example of a communicative interaction between two gliders is given. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of this analysis for the enactive approach to cognition.},

    abstract = {Abstract The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the direction of heavier, substrate-deforming, but chemically inert masses. This long-range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that is distorted above a threshold substrate strain—a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to make long-range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.},

    abstract = {Soft robots allow for interesting morphological and behavioral designs because they exhibit more degrees of freedom than robots composed of rigid parts. In particular, voxel-based soft robots (VSRs)—aggregations of elastic cubic building blocks—have attracted the interest of Robotics and Artificial Life researchers. VSRs can be controlled by changing the volume of individual blocks: simple, yet effective controllers that do not exploit the feedback of the environment, have been automatically designed by means of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).In this work we explore the possibility of evolving sensing controllers in the form of artificial neural networks: we hence allow the robot to sense the environment in which it moves. Although the search space for a sensing controller is larger than its non-sensing counterpart, we show that effective sensing controllers can be evolved which realize interesting locomotion behaviors. We also experimentally investigate the impact of the VSR morphology on the effectiveness of the search and verify that the sensing controllers are indeed able to exploit their sensing ability for better solving the locomotion task.},

We then propose an information theoretic notion of integrated spatiotemporal patterns which we believe can serve as the basic building block of an agent definition. We argue that these patterns are capable of solving the problems mentioned before. We also test this in some preliminary experiments.},

    abstract = {Swarm robotics is a promising approach for the coordination of large numbers of robots. While previous studies have shown that evolutionary robotics techniques can be applied to obtain robust and efficient self-organized behaviors for robot swarms, most studies have been conducted in simulation, and the few that have been conducted on real robots have been confined to laboratory environments. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a swarm robotics system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and uncontrolled environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in simulation for canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion, clustering, and monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers on a real swarm of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the evolved controllers transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a performance similar to the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that the evolved controllers display key properties of swarm intelligence-based control, namely scalability, flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in which the swarm performs a complete environmental monitoring task by combining multiple evolved controllers.},

abstract="This paper considers the problem of deploying a mobile sensor network in an unknown environment. A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial configuration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area `covered' by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-field-based approach to deployment. The fields are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.",

abstract = {Abstract Background: Embryonic development can often adjust its morphogenetic processes to counteract external perturbation. The existence of self-monitoring responses during pattern formation is of considerable importance to the biomedicine of birth defects, but has not been quantitatively addressed. To understand the computational capabilities of biological tissues in a molecularly tractable model system, we induced craniofacial defects in Xenopus embryos, then tracked tadpoles with craniofacial deformities and used geometric morphometric techniques to characterize changes in the shape and position of the craniofacial structures. Results: Canonical variate analysis revealed that the shapes and relative positions of perturbed jaws and branchial arches were corrected during the first few months of tadpole development. Analysis of the relative movements of the anterior-most structures indicates that misplaced structures move along the anterior–posterior and left–right axes in ways that are significantly different from their normal movements. Conclusions: Our data suggest a model in which craniofacial structures use a measuring mechanism to assess and adjust their location relative to other local organs. Understanding the correction mechanisms at work in this system could lead to the better understanding of the adaptive decision-making capabilities of living tissues and suggest new approaches to correct birth defects in humans.
