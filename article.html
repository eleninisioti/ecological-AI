<h1>Ecological Artificial Intelligence </h1>
<h2 id='subtitle'> Grounding Artificial Intelligence in the Origins of Human Behavior </h2>


<p> 'Can machines think?' When Turing posed this question in his seminal paper
    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1951-02887-001"> Computing machinery and intelligence </a>
    <dt-cite key="turing_computing_1950"> </dt-cite> in the '50s,  he inadvertently laid the ground for what was to
    become the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ground was set firmly: generations of researchers have been
    engineering cognitive architectures and introducing objective functions that we evaluate on carefully selected
    benchmarks, abiding to the Turing-test tradition. </p>

<p> We call this the <em> cognition-centric </em> approach and want to contrast it to the <em> ecological </em>
        approach. Under this alternative attitude towards creating AI, intelligence is viewed as an emergent product
        of adaptive systems interacting with their environments. While cognition-centric approaches attempt to reverse-engineer
    intelligent behavior by searching in the space of cognitive functions, ecological approaches search in the space of
    environmental properties to reverse-engineer the conditions that drive intelligent behavior.
</p>

    <p> Ecological perspectives abide in the study of biological organisms. From the emergence of vision systems
        <dt-cite key="gibson__2014"> </dt-cite>
         to that of religious beliefs <dt-cite key="botero_ecology_2014"> </dt-cite>, the environments encountered in a
        species' evolutionary trajectory have been used to explain why
        certain functions persist over others.
    </p>

    <h4> In this blog post, we will discuss why and how we should pursue an ecological approach to AI. In particular, we will: </h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;padding:10px">  From drug discovery to music composition, our human cultural repertoire relies on innovations produced
    by collectives that jointly explore, communicate and recombine solutions. Can artificial agents also innovate in
    collectives? In the learning paradigm of distributed RL, groups of agents solve tasks in parallel and share their
    experiences with observed benefits to performance. But, while biological organisms exhibit a variety of social
    network structures,, distributed RL agents always share with everyone. Here, we study the effect of social network

<p> At a first glance these two studies have nothing in common, except perhaps for their ecological attitude towards
    skill acquisition. At the end of this post we will see, however, that there is room for exchanging ideas between
    the two: recent ecological theories posit that elements in our environment such as the Sahara desert act as
    ecological barriers that prohibit immigration but can disappear during periods of extreme climatic variability
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQP-7BPvvq0"> did you know the Sahara was green a few tens of thousands
        of years ago?  </a> <dt-cite key="larrasoana_dynamics_2013"> </dt-cite>. This means that climatic variability
    may have affected social network structure, with interesting implications for the populations that needed to survive
    at the time  ...

    <h2 id="open-ended-skills-in"> Open-ended skills in biological and artificial agents </h2>

    <p> What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "open-endedness"? For many scientists,
        engineers and artists, it is "life" or "evolution", words that conjure images of biological agents with a wide
        diversity of forms and functions, entangled in a complex web of interactions. What makes biological
        open-endedness particularly mind-boggling is not just the diversity and complexity of solutions, but the
        apparent simplicity of the algorithm that continuously gives rise to them: evolution. </p>

    <p> AI researchers were also inspired from the open-endedness of biological evolution and attempted to imitate it by
        building artificial agents with large behavioral repertoires. Largely owing to achievements in deep learning,
        optimization using  reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms managed to produce agents with impressive
        behavioral repertoires:  populations of RL agents co-adapting with their environments managed to develop
        morphologies that can walk on challenging terrains <dt-cite key="wang_paired_2019"> </dt-cite>, a single RL agent
        trained using techniques developed for language models managed to play Atari games,
        chat and control a robotic arm <dt-cite key="reed_generalist_2022"> </dt-cite>, a team of RL agents playing
        Hide-and-Seek learned how to manipulate items in their environment to continuously pose new challenges to
        another team <dt-cite key="baker_emergent_2020"> </dt-cite>  and evolutionary algorithms that optimize for both
        diversity and quality managed to solve deceptive

<p> However, <b> progress in this direction is being hindered by </b>:  </p>

    <nav id="contentBlog" class="l-body" >

    <li style="..."> <b> the computational complexity of training large neural networks </b> One of the properties
        that we emphasize  when characterizing a skill as impressive, is the task complexity, largely associated to
        the size of the solution space an algorithm needs to search in to find the optimal behavior. In stark
        contrast to biological organisms that operate under severe constraints, such as energy consumption,
        artificial agents are classically trained from scratch with immense computational resources.
        (See Figure 1 for a ..). <a href="https://otoro.net/ml/"> The community has voiced its concerns about this
        attitude </a>  but who would expect AI researchers to self-limit their
        consumption of resources, even if this would be useful in the long-term? </li>
    <li style="..."> <b> brittleness of learned policies </b>  In nature, an organism's ability to solve a task
        usually implies that it can solve other similar tasks, an ability that we refer to as generalization. While
        a lot of progress is being made in generalization in AI, RL agents sometimes fail to generalize in cases
        that to humans seem trivial: see for example in Figure 2 the agent that learned how to beat humans in
        Pong but failed when the paddle was moved slightly up and to the right. </li>
    <li style="..."> <b> the deceptiveness of tasks </b> Evolutionary and RL algorithms classically take the
        optimization objective for granted, as it is provided  by the human designer. However, most trully
        challenging tasks are deceptive: if you directly optimize for the objective you want to evaluate it for, you
        will never achieve it, because greediness will keep you away from paths that you need to first explore. An exa </li>

</nav>


<p> We believe that these challenges are due to remnants of the cognition-centric approach and that an ecological
    approach can help us overcome them</p>

<h2 id="framework"> A conceptual framework for linking human and artificial ecologies </h2>

<p> We recently proposed <dt-cite key="nisioti_grounding_2021"> </dt-cite> that a possible pathway
    to overcome  these challenges  is by grounding our pursuit of open-ended skill acquisition in artificial
    systems in our knowledge of a natural species with an impressively open-ended behavioral repertoire: our own.
</p>


<p> Our methodology was three-step:

<ol type="1">


    <li style="..."> skim the Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) literature to identify the key factors that this
        community proposes as conducive for the evolution of the uniquely diverse human cultural repertoire
</li>
    <li style="..."> identify common research questions and hypotheses in AI, in particular the sub-fields of
        meta and multi-agent reinforcement learning
</li>
    <li style="..."> abstract away the particularities of the two fields to arrive at a  conceptual framework that
        unifies their terminologies and research agendas.
</li>

</ol>


<p> Here is our conceptual framework, to which we refer to as <em> ORIGINS </em>, that our work led to: </p>



<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/framework.png" height="465" width="665" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> Conceptual framework  <a href=""> []</a></i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> The schematic consists of two elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li> boxes represent categories of ecological mechanisms. </li>
    <li> arrows represent relationships between ecological components:
    <ul> <li> A feedforward link between box 'X' and 'Y' indicates that environmental dynamics inside 'X' is driving a
        skills inside 'Y'. In other words, it is acting as a selection pressure. For example, the fact that exposition
        to predators can promote cooperation is captured by the link
        [Environmental complexity] -> [Multi-agent dynamics]</li>
        <li> A feedback link between box 'X' and 'Y' has a different meaning: a skill in 'X' is modifying its
            environment by changing the dynamics in 'Y'. For example, the fact that tool use can alter resource
            availability is captured by the link [Cultural repertoire] -> [Environmental complexity]. </li>
    </ul>

    </li>
</ul>

<p> To discover works that study these links, including our own, you can hover over the arrows in the image.

</p>

<p> The story that the conceptual framework tells, put succinctly, is:
</p>

<p> <em> Environmental complexity  has a key role in  skill acquisition: it bootstraps the emergence
    of individual skills by modulating the need  for cognitive mechanisms and multi-agent skills through cooperation
    and competition pressures. The skills themselves then act as drivers of further skill acquisition in two ways:
    a) they interact with each other to give rise to the uniquely complex human cultural repertoire b)  they modulate
    environmental complexity through the process of niche construction, which creates a positive feedback loop that
    makes the process open-ended. </em> </p>

<p> <em> ORIGINS </em>  can be a useful tool for both communities:  AI researchers can borrow existing hypotheses from
    HBE about which environmental conditions affect which skills to appropriately shape their environments, an approach
    that we refer to as ecologically-inspired AI. At the same time, HBE researchers can use AI as a computational tool
    for studying their hypotheses.</p>
<p> In the rest of the post we give a more illustrative example of  ecologically-inspired AI through two of our works:
    we will zoom in in two different parts of the framework, discuss the ecological hypotheses they were inspired from,
    and then present the artificial ecologies we implemented to study them. </p>

<h2 id="Study-A"> Study A: Evolution of plasticity and evolvability in variable environments </h2>

<h3> Background in HBE </h3>
<p> What makes us human? For HBE researchers, this is not a philosophical inquiry, but a rather pressing scientific
    question: why did the first hominin species appear about 5 million years ago and which skills did they evolve
    that allowed them to expand into a  population that today holds a powerful position in the Earth's  ecosystem?</p>

<p> When we trace back the history of our planet, we find climatic records of very ''busy" periods : many rapid and
    large-amplitude climatic cycles have taken place in the last few milliion years, leading to high levels of climate
    change that must have significantly shaped populations at a global and local scale. Our own hominin space appeared
    and dispersed during such periods, competing and reproducing with other species.

</p>

<div style="clear: both;float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: calc((100vw - 1500px) / 2 + 168px);
width: calc((1500px - 648px) / 2 - 24px);">
  <img src="public/climate_Maslin.png" alt="scheme" style="width:94%">
    <p> Paleoclimatology records indicate that periods of high climatic variability were linked to the formation of
        lakes and the appearance of new hominin species.
        <dt-cite key="maslin_east_2014"> </dt-cite> Image source </a>   </p>
</div>

<p> How exactly did climatic conditions affect the evolution of the human species? The Pulsed Climate Variability
    (PCV) framework <dt-cite key="maslin_synthesis_2015"> </dt-cite>  has formalized this question into a set of
    hypotheses of how types of environmental variability affect evolutionary phenometa such as speciation, extinction,
    dispersal and diversity. </p>

<p> Under the PCV framework species are divided into two broad types: specialists are species that can survive in a
    limited range of environmental conditions, while generalists survive in a large range of conditions. As humans are
    a remarkably generalist species, we are very interested in which ecological conditions give rise to this type.
    With incomplete data about the environmental conditions and species of this period and, in the absence of
    theoretical models, answering this question in HBE in the near future seems unlikely. </p>

<h3> Background in AI </h3>

<p> A similar story has been unfolding in AI: in its quest for artificial agents that can generalize and quickly
    adapt to new tasks, the meta RL paradigm trains agents in a wide distribution of environments
    <dt-cite key="vanschoren_meta-learning_2018"> </dt-cite>.
 </p>


<p> Here, the agent adapts at two levels:
    <ul>
    <li> in an outer loop, we choose the environment that the agent will train on by
    randomly sampling out of a distribution of environments. This distribution is designed to balance between two
    objectives: on one hand we want this distribution to be as wide as possible, as this width determines the
    achievable generality of the agent. On the other hand, we want to keep the computational complexity low. This
    trade-off is usually solved by training meta-RL agents in a single domain (for example mazes with different
        layouts), but we have impressive examples of meta-Rl agents that can Atari games, chat and control a robotic
        arm <dt-cite key="reed2022a"> </dt-cite> </li>
    <li> in an inner loop, the agent learns to solve a single environment. But because this
    environment changes at every new outer loop, the agent is learning how to learn rather than learning the specific
    task. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> To draw a parallel with biological agents, we can see the outer-loop implementing the adaptive mechanism of
    evolution and the inner loop the adaptive mechanism of development.
</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/meta_RL.png" height="200" width="465" alt="metaRL" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> In meta-RL an agent is trained on a distribution of environments. </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> The main limitation here is computational complexity: the distribution of environments needs to be sampled
    densely enough to ensure generalization while the set of environments considered is limited within a single domain
    (for example mazes with different layouts). Also meta-learning set-ups usually consider a stationary distribution
    for sampling environments, thus ignoring the benefits of environments with certain dynamics, such as the ones
    proposed by the PCV framework </p>

<h3> A simple eco-evo-devo model </h3>

<p> Recently  we proposed a simple model for studying how populations of adaptive agents evolve  in variable
    environments <dt-cite key="nisioti_plasticity_2022"> </dt-cite>. Our objective was to provide a computational
    study of the hypotheses described under the PCV framework, drawing conclusions that in their turn can prove useful
    for evolutionary optimization and meta learning.</p>

<p> An important challenge in this project was to design an experimental setup that is powerful enough to capture the
    ecological dynamics and the evolution of diverse phenotypes but still computationally cheap so that we can simulate
    a wide range of conditions and large populations. </p>



<h4> Modeling an adaptive population. </h4>

<p> In AI, quantifying plasticity requires to simulate the interaction between an agent and the environment over many
timesteps (as e.g. in RL).  To avoid this complexity  of introducing an intra-lifetime loop for evaluation tasks, we
    have adopted tolerance curves, a tool originally  developed in ecology to model biological organisms <dt-cite
            key="grove_evolution_2014"> </dt-cite>.
</p>



<p> Tolerance curves have the form of a Gaussian whose mean shows the preferred environmental state of an individual and
    variance its plasticity, i.e., its ability to survive under different environmental conditions: </p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/tolerance_curves.png" width="65%" alt="toleranceCurve" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> An agent with low plasticity (on the left) has small &\sigma; and a high peak at their preferred niche, while a
    plastic individual (on the right) has large &\sigma; and a lower peak at their preferred niche. Fitness in a
    certain environmental state is computed as the probability density function of the distribution at that point
the plastic individual has lower fitness (cost of plasticity). If $e_n >>\mu_k$ (the actual environmental state differs
    significantly from the preferred one) the plastic individual has higher fitness (benefit of plasticity)

</i></sub>
</div>
    </div>

<p> Tolerance curves elegantly capture the cost and benefit of plasticity: if a plastic and non-plastic agent compete
    in an environment that is identical to their preferred niche, the plastic one will lose as its peak is lower. But
    if, for some reason, the environment changes in the next generation so that it differs from the preferred niche
    of the two individuals, the plastic one will be at an advantage.
</p>

<p> In addition to this plasticity, an agent can adapt using its evolvability (r;), which refers to the amount of
    mutations that take place between generations.
</p>

 <p>
To decide which agents in a population survive in the following generation we implemented two selection mechanisms:
 </p>

<ul>
    <li> fitness-based selection. This is the classical survival-of-the-fittest critertion where agents are selected
        proportionally to their fitness </li>

    <li> niche-limited competition. Under this mechanism, agents surviving in a niche reproduce within it, with the
        number of reproductions being limited by capacity. Thus, an agent can increase its chances of reproduction by
        surviving in multiple niches. </li>

</ul>

<p> At each generation, the three elements of an agent's genome evolve as: </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">

<var> &mu; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>&mu; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
<var> &sigma; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>&sigma; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
<var> r; <sub>{t+1} </var> = <var>r; <sub>{t}</var> + <var>N(0, r<sub>{t})</var>
</div>




<h4> Modeling an ecologically-complex environment </h4>

<p> We have hinted that we want to simulate a variable environment, but how exactly can we go about this, while
    keeping the computational complexity of the simulations low? In this work, we have defined a model that comprises a
    number of niches &N and a climate function e_g that characterizes the environmental state of each niche.  </p>


<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">
<img class="80" src="public/niches.png" width="65%" alt="ORIGINS" />
<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> The environment consists of multiple niches, each characterized by its latitude $n$ and a climate function that has
    the same form for each niche except by a vertical offset proportional to the niche index.</i></sub>
</div>
</div>



<h4> Observing populations evolve under climate change </h4>

<p> To disentangle the effect of the two selection mechanisms we experimented with three variants of the evolutionary
    algorithm:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> F-selection employs only fitness-based selection </li>
    <li> N-selection employs only niche-limited competition</li>
    <li> NF-selection employs both </li>
</ul>

<p> We have also simulated words with various number of niches and three types of climate functions:</p>
<ul>

    <li> <b> stable climate </b> Here we can control the quality of the climate: words with higher environmental
        states are higher quality, as they can support larger populations. In this case, we saw that low-quality
        environments with multiple niches favor plasticity provided niche-limited competition is active: as an
        individual can reproduce in any of the niches it can survive in, higher plasticity means higher chances of
        reproduction, which counteracts the cost of plasticity. As the quality of environments increases the benefit of
        plasticity disappears: non-plastic individuals dominate the available niches even though some individuals choose
        to disperse.
    </li>
    <li> <b> sinusoid variation </b> Here, we can control the amount and frequency of variation. We observed
        F-selection and N-selection lead to mal-adapted populations that can tolerate less change.
        .. </li>
    <li> <b> Noisy climate </b> Here, we control for the amount of uncertainty. We observed that introducing
        niche-limited competition is necessary for the population to survive and that N-selection adapts purely
        through plasticity while NF-selection adapts through both plasticity and evolvability.
    </li>
</ul>


<p> We observed that the three algorithms lead to very different behavior. For example, for sinusoidal variation under
    F-selection the plasticity and the evolvabiltiy of the population is low and variability is dealt with by
    continous migration as the following visualization shows on the left. In contrast when we employ NF-selection
    in the same environmental setup both plasticity and evolvability remain high and the population expands to all
    niches (on the right). </p>

<h3> Discussion </h3>
<p> In these experiments, agents can freely moves in niches, as long as they can survive in them. If they have high
    plasticity, the population therefore necessarily becomes well-mixed. This contrasts with real ecological
    dynamics, where ecological barriers can appear and disappear. For example, under the Green Sahara ... and the
    Iberian ..., . Such conditions are hypothesizes to have an important effect on both biological and cultural
    evolution <dv-cite key="derrico_evolution_2011">  </dv-cite>  <dv-cite key="derrico_identifying_2013">  </dv-cite>

<h2 id="sapiens"> Study B: the effect of social network structure on collective innovation </h2>

<p> When we talk about human culture, things like art, science and language, we often tend to emphasize the contributions of
    certain innovative individuals. This "lonely genius" narrative obscures the true, collective nature of human culture:
    from hunter-gatherers tens of thousands of years ago <dt-cite key="migliano_origins_2022"> </dt-cite> to today's
    research networks, humans innovate in groups. They observe innovations in their own past and their social
    environment and recombine them to form new innovations that in their turn become the material forming future innovation.

<p> The two groups on the left and right of Figure ... are very different: they regard populations inhabiting different
    temporal and spatial scales. The activities they regard however (art and technology for the cultural networks of Africa
    and science for the contemporary research network) share some similarities: they are both processes of collective
    innovation. When we glance at them, we get a very similar global picture of the social network structure: intense
    communication takes place in small clusters and some long-range connections ensure that some information travels to
    far-away clusters. Is this a coincidence or can we attribute this similarity in social network structure to common
    properties of these networks?
</p>

<h3> Background in HBE </h3>

<p> Understanding how the social environment affects the behavior of human groups is an important objective
    in fields studying human decision-making, such as psychology, cognitive science and archeology
    <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="masonPropagationInnovationsNetworked2008"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="masonCollaborativeLearningNetworks2012"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="fang_balancing_2010"> </dt-cite>. Such an understanding would help in two distinct ways: a) it would
    help us analyze the history of our own species, where many major events were contingent on the social network
    structure and, in general, the ecology of populations. Why did most first human civilisations appear on the same latitude?
    Why did Europe have the most advanced war technology in the 16th century? b) it would help us anticipate the future:
    if we know which social network structure is most appropriate for best-responding to a problem
    then we can organize our human resources appropriately. Such questions are often asked for example in organizational
    management research <dt-cite key="fang_balancing_2010"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> Early on, studies confirmed that there is something about the social network structure that affects the behavior of
    groups: in more densely connected groups information propagates quicker so that the group becomes homogeneous,
    while partially-connected groups can maintain some diversity of information in different sub-clusters. This makes these
    two broad categories of social network structures appropriate for different types of problems:
    easy problems (ones with a single and obvious solution) are most efficiently solved when
    the group is densely connected. Difficult problems, on the other hand, (ones where the optimal solution is hidden
    among many sub-optimal solutions) are better solved by partially-connected groups.
</p>

<p> What type of problem is cultural innovation? The landscape of innovation has a multi-level structure, where previous
    solutions become the material for new solutions. At the same time, newly discovered solutions are more interesting and
    likely to lead to new solutions, which biases innovation towards a forward march. Both these properties were captured
    by an influential study of human innovation <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"> </dt-cite>, where
    two types of groups (a fully-connected and a partially-connected) competed on an innovation task inspired from drug
    discovery.
</p>

</div>
</div>

<p> In this task, one starts with a set of elements which they can combine in triplets. Some triplets are valid, in the
    sense that they lead to the creation of a new element and incur a reward. Once the player finds a valid triplet, they
    can use the newly created element to then search for a new valid triplet. Triplets belong to one of two trajectories,
    the blue and the red: elements discovered in a trajectory are only useful for it. This means that once you find a valid
    triplet you are incentivised to stay in the same trajectory. But there is a catch: when you reach the fourth element,
    you need an element from the other trajectory. This is what makes this task deceptive: to solve it optimally
    (get ...) you need to act sub-optimally in the short-term (explore the other trajectory instead of just marching
    forward).
</p>

<h3> Background in AI </h3>

<p> Artificial agents search in collectives too. In RL, training the agents on learning to solve a task requires immense
    amounts of data. These data are collected by interacting with an environment, a computationally expensive process that
    becomes more manageable if one parallelizes the algorithm. By having multiple agents collecting data in their own copy
    of the environment and delivering them to a central node that trains the policy, we can achieve a reduction in training
    time linear to the number of agents. This is the paradigm of decentralized RL, which is so prominent that today, the most
    popular RL algorithms are not a single agent but a group of agents
    <dt-cite key="mnihAsynchronousMethodsDeep2016a"></dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="horganDistributedPrioritizedExperience2018"> </dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="espeholt_impala_2018"> </dt-cite>.
</p>

<p> This architecture where multiple workers communicate with a central learner that updates a single policy and returns
    it back to them is called a star topology and is, if not the only, the most prominent architecture used in
    decentralized RL. We hypothesize that the reason this choice dominated is that designers believe that this
    fully-connected architecture is best for sample complexity: the more information the agents in the group have the
    better, right?
</p>

<p> Having read our review of human studies, you too must be thinking that the answer to this question may not
    necessarily be "yes". In the next sub-section, we will describe our study of the effect of social network structure in
    distributed RL where the group is solving a task inspired by
    <dt-cite key="derexPartialConnectivityIncreases2016"></dt-cite>.  </p>

<h3> SAPIENS: a distributed RL framework with structured groups </h3>

<p> SAPIENS is a learning framework belonging to the decentralized RL learning paradigm that connects multiple
    learners based on a pre-defined social network structure. One can imagine many instantiations of it that differ for
    example in the learning algorithm employed and the type of information shared. In this project, we have studied a
    single instantiation with DQN learners that share experience tuples from their replay buffer.

</div>

<p> We studied five different social network structures: fully-connected, ring, small-world (which we designed according
    to the Watts-Strogatz model) and dynamic. In the latter, the agents start in sub-groups of two and during training
    may visit other subgroups wiht probability <var> p <sub>v </var>  for a duration of <var> T <sub>v </var> time steps.

<i> </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<h3> Designing innovation tasks </h3>

<p> To study innovation, we want create tasks that have the multi-level structure that we described. We also want to be
flexible: we would like to try innovation tasks that vary in the length of the innovation path-ways (how many elements
    do we want the agents to create?) and the learning challenge involved (what challengs does a single or multiple learners
    face when trying to reach the maximum innovation level?).
</p>

<p> To achieve this we employed Wordcraft <dt-cite key="jiangWordCraftEnvironmentBenchmarking2020"> </dt-cite>,
    a test-bed inspired from the Little Alchemy game. Wordcraft was originally introduced to capture the common-sense
    abilities of RL agents: the innovation tasks were creating by quering a database in natural language that indicates
    which combinations of elements are possible in our human world (for example you can combine `fire` with 'water' to make
    'steam' but it does not make sense to combine 'fire' with 'rock').  Our project had a different objective: we want to
    create innovation tasks that pose different challenges but are not necessarily real-world objects. For this reason,
    we created three custom tasks with symbolic elements:
    <ul>
    <li> <b> single-path  task </b>:a task with a single innovation path to an easy-to-find global optimum.
        This type of task can be used to model a linear innovation structure, such as the evolution of the fork from
        knife to having, two-, three- and, eventually four tines, and is not a deceptive task.
    </li>
    <li>  <b> merging-paths task</b>: a task with two paths that individually lead to local optima, but when combined,
        can merge toward the global optimum. Inspired from previous studies in cognitive science this task we can capture
        innovations that were repurposed after their invention, such as Gutenberg's screw press leading to the print
        press.}
    </li>
    <li> <b> best-of-ten paths task</b>: \item a task with ten paths, only one of which leads to the global optimum,
        which captures search in vast spaces
    </li>

    </ul>
</p>

<h3> Observing different social network structures in different innovation tasks
</h3>

<p> Do the different social network structures behave differently, and do these differences depend on the task at hand?
This is the main question that we aimed to address with our empirical analysis. We evaluated performance in terms of two
    metrics: the maximum reward within the group after convergence (<var> R <sub>max </var>) and the time it took it to
    reach this performance (<var> T<sub>+</var>). The results are summarised in the following figure:
</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom:40px">

<div>
<sub style="display: block; line-height: 1.5em">
<i> </i></sub>
</div>
</div>

<p> Our analysis showed that:
<ul>
    <li> In the <b> single-path task</b>: there was no important differences between the structures. Interestingly, more
        sharing did not lead to quicker convergence. Instead, the fully-connected structure was the slowest to converge.
    </li>
    <li> In the <b> merging-paths task</b>: </li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3> Discussion </h3>

<p> In this work we showed that the social network structure of RL agents matters and that dynamic structures perform best
across different tasks. We believe that the contribution of this study is two-fold:

<p> For RL research,

Instead, they result from a cumulative process in which innovations are gradually added to existing cultural traits across many generations. Recent work suggests that a population’s ability to develop complex technologies is positively affected by its size and connectedness. Here, we present a simple computer-based experiment that compares the accumulation of innovations by fully and partially connected groups of the same size in a complex fitness landscape. We find that the propensity to learn from successful individuals drastically reduces cultural diversity within fully connected groups. In comparison, partially connected groups produce more diverse solutions, and this diversity allows them to develop complex solutions that are never produced in fully connected groups. These results suggest that explanations of ancestral patterns of cultural complexity may need to consider levels of population fragmentation and interaction patterns between partially isolated groups.},

We simulate such an organization, systematically varying the interaction pattern between individuals to explore how the degree of subgroup isolation and inter-group connectivity influences organizational learning. We also test this model with a range of contingency variables highlighted in the management research. We find that moderate levels of cross-group linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across groups without reducing organizational diversity too quickly. This finding is remarkably resilient to a wide range of variance in factors such as problem complexity, environmental dynamism, and personnel turnover.},

	abstract = {The archaeological record shows that typically human cultural traits emerged at different times, in different parts of the world, and among different hominin taxa. This pattern suggests that their emergence is the outcome of complex and nonlinear evolutionary trajectories, influenced by environmental, demographic, and social factors, that need to be understood and traced at regional scales. The application of predictive algorithms using archaeological and paleoenvironmental data allows one to estimate the ecological niches occupied by past human populations and identify niche changes through time, thus providing the possibility of investigating relationships between cultural innovations and possible niche shifts. By using such methods to examine two key southern Africa archaeological cultures, the Still Bay [76–71 thousand years before present (ka)] and the Howiesons Poort (HP; 66–59 ka), we identify a niche shift characterized by a significant expansion in the breadth of the HP ecological niche. This expansion is coincident with aridification occurring across Marine Isotope Stage 4 (
              ca.
              72–60 ka) and especially pronounced at 60 ka. We argue that this niche shift was made possible by the development of a flexible technological system, reliant on composite tools and cultural transmission strategies based more on “product copying” rather than “process copying.” These results counter the one niche/one human taxon equation. They indicate that what makes our cultures, and probably the cultures of other members of our lineage, unique is their flexibility and ability to produce innovations that allow a population to shift its ecological niche.},

	abstract = {Crucial questions in the debate on the origin of quintessential human behaviours are whether modern cognition and associated innovations are unique to our species and whether they emerged abruptly, gradually or as the result of a discontinuous process. Three scenarios have been proposed to account for the origin of cultural modernity. The first argues that modern cognition is unique to our species and the consequence of a genetic mutation that took place approximately 50 ka in Africa among already evolved anatomically modern humans. The second posits that cultural modernity emerged gradually in Africa starting at least 200 ka in concert with the origin of our species on that continent. The third states that innovations indicative of modern cognition are not restricted to our species and appear and disappear in Africa and Eurasia between 200 and 40 ka before becoming fully consolidated. We evaluate these scenarios in the light of new evidence from Africa, Asia and Europe and explore the mechanisms that may have led to modern cultures. Such reflections will demonstrate the need for further inquiry into the relationship between climate and demographic/cultural change in order to better understand the mechanisms of cultural transmission at work in Neanderthals and early

These two established findings, however, are rarely related within a single framework. This article bridges this gap via the development of a very simple evolutionary algorithm that tracks both directional selection and the evolution of plasticity under various synthetic climatic regimes. The output of the model allows for the construction of a dispersal index that provides a measure of population-level dispersal potential under each particular climatic regime. The output thus establishes both the timing and extent of selection for plasticity and the consequences of that plasticity for the timing of probable dispersal events in the context of climatic instability. Results suggest that periods of low climatic instability abruptly following extended periods of higher climatic instability are particularly conducive to dispersal, leading to the formulation of the Accumulated Plasticity Hypothesis. These results, and the hypothesis they support, are discussed in relation to the varied manifestations of plasticity in biological systems and their relevance to human evolution.},

	abstract = {The diversity and quality of natural systems have been a puzzle and inspiration for communities studying artificial life. It is now widely admitted that the adaptation mechanisms enabling these properties are largely influenced by the environments they inhabit. Organisms facing environmental variability have two alternative adaptation mechanisms operating at different timescales: {\textbackslash}textit\{plasticity\}, the ability of a phenotype to survive in diverse environments and {\textbackslash}textit\{evolvability\}, the ability to adapt through mutations. Although vital under environmental variability, both mechanisms are associated with fitness costs hypothesized to render them unnecessary in stable environments. In this work, we study the interplay between environmental dynamics and adaptation in a minimal model of the evolution of plasticity and evolvability. We experiment with different types of environments characterized by the presence of niches and a climate function that determines the fitness landscape. We empirically show that environmental dynamics affect plasticity and evolvability differently and that the presence of diverse ecological niches favors adaptability even in stable environments. We perform ablation studies of the selection mechanisms to separate the role of fitness-based selection and niche-limited competition. Results obtained from our minimal model allow us to propose promising research directions in the study of open-endedness in biological and artificial systems.},

	abstract = {Investigations into how climate change shaped human evolution have begun to focus on environmental dynamics, i.e., the nature and tempo of climate and landscape variability, an approach that de-emphasizes static reconstructions of early hominin habitats. The interaction among insolation cycles is especially apparent in the paleoenvironmental records of the East African Rift System, where the longest records of human evolution are preserved. However, environmental indicators such as deep-sea oxygen isotopes, terrestrial dust ﬂux, paleosol carbon isotopes, and lake sediments do not point consistently to any simple trend or climate driver of evolutionary change. Comparison of environmental indicators cautions against an exclusive focus on any given end-member of environmental ﬂuctuation (driest or wettest, warmest or coolest), and argues for the impact of the entire range of variability in shaping evolutionary change. A model of alternating high and low climate variability for tropical Africa further implies that speciﬁc environmental indicators reﬂect different aspects of East African environmental dynamics. The model may thus help reconcile some of the conﬂicting interpretations about the environmental drivers of hominin evolution. First and last appearances of hominin lineages, benchmark biogeographic events, and the emergence of key adaptations and capacities to alter the surroundings are consistently concentrated in the predicted longest intervals of high climate variability. The view that emerges is that important changes in stone technology, sociality, and other aspects of hominin behavior can now be understood as adaptive responses to heightened habitat instability.},

	abstract = {The traditional concept of long and gradual, glacial–interglacial climate changes during the Quaternary has been challenged since the 1980s. High temporal resolution analysis of marine, terrestrial and ice geological archives has identified rapid, millennial- to centennial-scale, and large-amplitude climatic cycles throughout the last few million years. These changes were global but have had contrasting regional impacts on the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, with in some cases strong changes in the high latitudes of both hemispheres but muted changes elsewhere. Such a regionalization has produced environmental barriers and corridors that have probably triggered niche contractions/expansions of hominin populations living in Eurasia and Africa. This article reviews the long- and short-timescale ecosystem changes that have punctuated the last few million years, paying particular attention to the environments of the last 650,000 years, which have witnessed key events in the evolution of our lineage in Africa and Eurasia. This review highlights, for the first time, a contemporaneity between the split between Denisovan and Neanderthals, at 650–400 ka, and the strong Eurasian ice-sheet expansion down to the Black Sea. This ice expansion could form an ice barrier between Europe and Asia that may have triggered the genetic drift between these two populations.},

Hence, over the past two decades, there has been intensive work undertaken to understand African palaeoclimate and tectonics in order to put together a coherent picture of how the environment of Africa has varied over the past 10 Myr. A new consensus is emerging that suggests the unusual geology and climate of East Africa created a complex, environmentally very variable setting. This new understanding of East African climate has led to the pulsed climate variability hypothesis that suggests the long-term drying trend in East Africa was punctuated by episodes of short alternating periods of extreme humidity and aridity which may have driven hominin speciation, encephalization and dispersals out of Africa. This hypothesis is unique as it provides a conceptual framework within which other evolutionary theories can be examined: first, at macro-scale comparing phylogenetic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium; second, at a more focused level of human evolution comparing allopatric speciation, aridity hypothesis, turnover pulse hypothesis, variability selection hypothesis, Red Queen hypothesis and sympatric speciation based on sexual selection. It is proposed that each one of these mechanisms may have been acting on hominins during these short periods of climate variability, which then produce a range of different traits that led to the emergence of new species. In the case of Homo erectus (sensu lato), it is not just brain size that changes but life history (shortened inter-birth intervals, delayed development), body size and dimorphism, shoulder morphology to allow thrown projectiles, adaptation to long-distance running, ecological flexibility and social behaviour. The future of evolutionary research should be to create evidence-based meta-narratives, which encompass multiple mechanisms that select for different traits leading ultimately to speciation.},

Over the last two decades, there has been intensive work undertaken to understand African palaeoclimate and tectonics in order to put together a coherent picture of how the environment of East Africa has varied in the past. The landscape of East Africa has altered dramatically over the last 10 million years. It has changed from a relatively flat, homogenous region covered with mixed tropical forest, to a varied and heterogeneous environment, with mountains over 4 km high and vegetation ranging from desert to cloud forest. The progressive rifting of East Africa has also generated numerous lake basins, which are highly sensitive to changes in the local precipitation-evaporation regime. There is now evidence that the presence of precession-driven, ephemeral deep-water lakes in East Africa were concurrent with major events in hominin evolution. It seems the unusual geology and climate of East Africa created periods of highly variable local climate, which, it has been suggested could have driven hominin speciation, encephalisation and dispersal out of Africa. One example is the significant hominin speciation and brain expansion event at ∼1.8 Ma that seems to have been coeval with the occurrence of highly variable, extensive, deep-water lakes. This complex, climatically very variable setting inspired first the variability selection hypothesis, which was then the basis for the pulsed climate variability hypothesis. The newer of the two suggests that the long-term drying trend in East Africa was punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme humidity and aridity. Both hypotheses, together with other key theories of climate-evolution linkages, are discussed in this paper. Though useful the actual evolution mechanisms, which led to early hominins are still unclear and continue to be debated. However, it is clear that an understanding of East African lakes and their palaeoclimate history is required to understand the context within which humans evolved and eventually left East Africa.},

Although this ability is fundamentally related to the characteristics of human intelligence, research in this field rarely considers the processes and ecological conditions that may have guided the emergence of complex cognitive capacities during the evolution of the species. Research in Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) seeks to understand how the behaviors characterizing human nature can be conceived as adaptive responses to major changes in our ecological niche. In this paper, we propose a framework highlighting the role of environmental complexity in open-ended skill acquisition, grounded in major hypotheses from HBE and recent contributions in Reinforcement learning (RL). We use this framework to highlight fundamental links between the two disciplines, as well as to identify feedback loops that bootstrap ecological complexity and create promising research directions for AI researchers. We also present our first steps towards designing a simulation environment that implements the climate dynamics necessary for studying key HBE hypotheses relating environmental complexity to skill acquisition.},

	abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet, evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms (e.g., novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},

We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific intelligence tests.},

The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens. In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities of Gato.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1901.01753},
	abstract = {While the history of machine learning so far largely encompasses a series of problems posed by researchers and algorithms that learn their solutions, an important question is whether the problems themselves can be generated by the algorithm at the same time as they are being solved. Such a process would in effect build its own diverse and expanding curricula, and the solutions to problems at various stages would become stepping stones towards solving even more challenging problems later in the process. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper does just that: it pairs the generation of environmental challenges and the optimization of agents to solve those challenges. It simultaneously explores many different paths through the space of possible problems and solutions and, critically, allows these stepping-stone solutions to transfer between problems if better, catalyzing innovation. The term open-ended signifies the intriguing potential for algorithms like POET to continue to create novel and increasingly complex capabilities without bound. Our results show that POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization alone, or even through a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm introduced to highlight the critical role of open-endedness in solving ambitious challenges. The ability to transfer solutions from one environment to another proves essential to unlocking the full potential of the system as a whole, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of fortuitous stepping stones. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains, where algorithms like POET can blaze a trail through their interesting possible manifestations and solutions.},

	abstract = {Astronomically forced insolation changes have driven monsoon dynamics and recurrent humid episodes in North Africa, resulting in green Sahara Periods (GSPs) with savannah expansion throughout most of the desert. Despite their potential for expanding the area of prime hominin habitats and favouring out-of-Africa dispersals, GSPs have not been incorporated into the narrative of hominin evolution due to poor knowledge of their timing, dynamics and landscape composition at evolutionary timescales. We present a compilation of continental and marine paleoenvironmental records from within and around North Africa, which enables identification of over 230 GSPs within the last 8 million years. By combining the main climatological determinants of woody cover in tropical Africa with paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic data for representative (Holocene and Eemian) GSPs, we estimate precipitation regimes and habitat distributions during GSPs. Their chronology is consistent with the ages of Saharan archeological and fossil hominin sites. Each GSP took 2–3 kyr to develop, peaked over 4–8 kyr, biogeographically connected the African tropics to African and Eurasian mid latitudes, and ended within 2–3 kyr, which resulted in rapid habitat fragmentation. We argue that the well-dated succession of GSPs presented here may have played an important role in migration and evolution of hominins.},

	abstract = {Although ecological forces are known to shape the expression of sociality across a broad range of biological taxa, their role in shaping human behavior is currently disputed. Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91\%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.},
